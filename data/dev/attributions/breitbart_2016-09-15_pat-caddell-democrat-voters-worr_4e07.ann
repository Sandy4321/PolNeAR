T15	Content 575 842;843 1076	"The health issue overall is very much a partisan issue, but that doesn’t account for almost the same numbers here, which, I’m going to read you the question: “As you know, Hillary Clinton left an event on September 11th earlier than scheduled due to health concerns. It was later revealed to be pneumonia. Do you think Hillary’s health concerns negatively impact her ability to serve as President?” Forty-three, yes; forty-four, no. Rasmussen has a similar question: forty-three, yes; forty-six, no."
