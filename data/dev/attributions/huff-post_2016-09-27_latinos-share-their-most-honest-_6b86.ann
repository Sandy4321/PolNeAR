We are the indigenous people of this continent and we are hard working people from a rich and ancient culture that goes beyond taco trucks and illicit behavior. My great grandma worked in the fields all her life picking the food and cotton for this country. Furthermore, his obnoxious and cruel views on women Is not progressive for women’s rights and future advancements. Trump is making a mockery of our political system. He’s a belligerent, discursive hot head who is a power monger. To quote Bob Marley ‘Some people are so poor all they have is money.” And that’s all he has “the root of all evil’.”
