Retired General Reveals ‘Demoralizing’ Experience Of Serving Under Obama.

Retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Norman Ham is speaking out ahead of the presidential election about the serious problems he has with the current commander in chief — and why he believes GOP nominee Donald Trump has the best plan to correct the American military’s current course.

In an interview with Trending Today USA with Rusty Humphries, Ham made it clear he had major misgivings about the armed forces under President Barack Obama at the time of his retirement two years ago.

“Now that I don’t have to be politically correct anymore,” he told the host, “it was demoralizing to work for Obama.”

Ham went on to explain how he believes cuts to military spending left his and other generals’ hands tied when attempting to perform their duties.

“Sequestration severely handicapped our military training-wise, readiness, equipment, facilities,” he said. “It was demoralizing. Your whole job as a general is to take care of people; because when you take care of people, you get the mission done. We weren’t allowed to take care of the people the way we needed to take care of people.”

While he acknowledged funding was a major reason he felt demoralized serving under Obama, Ham also noted several “intangibles” left him further disillusioned.

“When we’re trading, you know, traitors for terrorists,” he said. “We’re paying ransom to the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.”

According to Ham, the current administration has shuffled through military leaders because many disagreed with Obama’s policies.

“We’re on our fourth secretary of defense,” he said. “There’s a reason for that. None of them gave Obama the answer that he wanted.”

Looking ahead to the future of the armed forces and the nation, Ham explained why he backs Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

“This country needs a leader,” he said. “We need a leader with integrity, a leader that sees goodness in all Americans that can bring up together and lead us forward.”

In contrast, Ham described Clinton as “a lifetime politician” who “has never accomplished a real job in her life.”
