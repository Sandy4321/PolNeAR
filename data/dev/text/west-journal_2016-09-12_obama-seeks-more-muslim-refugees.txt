Obama Seeks More Muslim Refugees As He Recognizes Major Islamic Holiday.

President Barack Obama sounded a call for the United States to accept more Muslim refugees on Monday as he issued a statement in observance of the Muslim holiday Eid-al-Adha.

The holiday is observed as a Muslim day of sacrifice, during which Muslims worldwide will kill and ritually sacrifice animals.

Obama called the holiday “a celebration of the ways faith can transcend any differences or boundaries and unite us under the banners of fellowship and love.”

“[W]e are reminded of the millions of refugees around the globe who are spending this sacred holiday separated from their families, unsure of their future, but still hoping for a brighter tomorrow,” Obama said.

“As a nation, we remain committed to welcoming the stranger with empathy and an open heart — from the refugee who flees war-torn lands to the immigrant who leaves home in search of a better life,” he said.

Last month, the Obama administration announced it had reached its goal of accepting 10,000 refugees from Syria.

However, Christian News Service reported that the administration had exceeded the goal.

CNS reported Monday that the U.S. had accepted 11,491 Syrian refugees, 15 percent over the limit of 10,000, which was reached on Aug. 29.

The State Department Refugee Processing Center said that 98.33 percent of the Syrian refugees are Sunni Muslims.

According to the data, Christians make up less than half of 1 percent of the Syrians arriving in the United States. To date, 14 Catholics, six Orthodox, four Protestants and one Greek Orthodox were admitted as well as 29 others who only specified “Christian” as their religion.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said that the United States cannot afford to continue running the security risk of accepting Syrian refugees because there is no viable way to determine the backgrounds of those seeking entrance to the U.S.

“Bad, bad things are going to happen,” Trump warned in Everett, Wash., recently. “This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.”

At a rally, Trump likened the refugees to a “vicious snake” in a song about a woman who takes in a half-frozen snake only to have it fatally bite her.

“You knew damn well that I was a snake before you took me in,” Trump told the crowd, reciting the reptile’s taunt of the dying woman.
