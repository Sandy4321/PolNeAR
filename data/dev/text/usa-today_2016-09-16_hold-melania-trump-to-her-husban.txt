Hold Melania Trump to her husband's standards.

LETTERS.

Ouisa Davis' commentary, "Melania, tell your immigrant story," is very thoughtful. Several weeks ago, Donald Trump stated that Melania would discuss her immigration history "in a few weeks." But those few weeks have come and gone without explanation. Now Melania seems to have vanished from the campaign trail.

I live and work in Manhattan and have many actor friends who are immigrants. I have written letters for several of them, trying to help them secure visas and citizenship -- it is not an easy process. As stated in Davis' commentary, there are conflicting stories and many questions about how his wife was able to work here and become a citizen. It is simply astounding that Trump demands accountability and transparency from our president, yet refuses to release his tax records or explain how his wife became a citizen.

While having a heated debate about the presidential nominees, a friend commented: "For you, immigration is the most important reason to not vote for Trump."

She is right! My wife and I arrived in the U.S. as teens. She came from the Middle East and I from South America. We got married here, had three great kids and built a business. The U.S. became a home we care more about than our native countries. After living in different parts of the world, we are convinced this is the only country in which one can come from zero, work hard and become anything. I despise Trump because his speech is full of hate. He brings out the worst in people. Many of his supporters believe bigotry and xenophobia are acceptable. Some opponents are using a voice that is louder and more hostile than his. His intolerance has turned me into a combatant!

We asked whether Melania Trump's story would influence the credibility of her husband's policies.

Give her a break. Melania was born in a poor communist country. She had to make ends meet.

Nothing about them seems credible to me.

@mdeluzgon.

We don't care. Everything Trump says is a lie unless proven otherwise. We aren't blind.

@Jmdmd1Maurice.

Seriously, Melania's story is the bottom of the pile. Taxes? Foundation? Foreign deals?

@plish516.

Only European immigrants are "safe" in his eyes.

@xxkillacam214.

Yes, he seems to have a different set of rules for his wife and young models opposed to Mexicans.

@casawhitby.

No. Donand Trump has money and seems to think he is exempt.
