Flight attendants' union endorses Clinton.

A union representing flight attendants endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday, another example of organized labor throwing its support behind the nominee.

In a statement announcing the pick, the Association of Flight Attendants called Clinton a “champion” for its constituency, citing her work after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and position on including the union’s members in Family and Medical Leave Act benefits.

The statement also referenced the impact it said Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party, would have on women in the workplace: “Parallel to our union's progress for flight attendants, Secretary Clinton's fight, long and historic, has opened the door for women to overcome discrimination, sexism and become equal partners in shaping our future,” the union wrote.

The Association of Flight Attendants represents almost 50,000 workers.

Other major unions, including the American Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO, have also endorsed Clinton in the race.

But Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump, has been successfully courting working-class voters, especially white men and some of them union members, through his campaign theme of questioning trade deals, hurting Democrats’ standing with a once-loyal voting bloc.
