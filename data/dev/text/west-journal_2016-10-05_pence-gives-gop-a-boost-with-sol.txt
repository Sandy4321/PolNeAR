Pence Gives GOP A Boost With Solid Debate Win Over Kaine.

Republican vice presidential candidate Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana was the hands-down winner of Tuesday night’s debate, according to the post-debate analysis.

“I thought that Mike Pence did all the things right that Donald Trump did wrong,” said MSNBC host Chris Matthews. “His body language was excellent. He was very good on reaction. He looked like a grown-up. … he came across as a grown-up, strong.”

“I thought he was very effective at being a conservative. But I really think what he accomplished tonight, is made himself probably the front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2020,” Matthews said.

Matthews said Pence’s performance should boost Trump’s poll numbers.

“I thought he was very effective at securing Trump’s right-wing flank. And I think that may be important in the numbers in the next couple days,” he said.

However, he characterized Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., as, “a little desperate there, jumping in all the time, always trying to get his points, and he didn’t wait his turn. Obviously, if he had just waited his turn, the back and forth nature of this kind of event, he would have had his opportunity. … I think that hurt him.”

“… overall, I think the winner tonight will end up being, in terms of the debate and what they were trying to accomplish, Pence, because Pence really was solid, he looked like he had his head screwed on, and I think that’s going to look very important for Trump,” Matthews concluded.

Dan McLaughlin at the National Review agreed with Matthews about the winner.

“If Pence’s goal was to make Kaine defend business as usual – defend the corruptions of Hillary Clinton (with the mantra of ‘there was a full investigation’) and the madness of the Iran deal – he succeeded with flying colors,” he wrote.

Pence was also dubbed the debate winner on social media Tuesday night.

Pence was the subject of 60 percent of the Twitter conversation about the debate, Twitter announced, gaining 22,000 Twitter followers.

Writing for a Los Angeles Times panel that all agreed Pence won the debate, Mark Z. Barabak noted that the way Pence carried himself was critical to his success.

” … he delivered a mix of conservative orthodoxy and there-you-go-again rejoinders with a coolness and polish that Ronald Reagan himself might have admired,” Barabak wrote.
