Railing Against Trump, Sanders Vows To Eliminate Tax Breaks Used By Real Estate Developers.

If Donald Trump could make money doing it, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is against it.

Based on the evidence of a New York Times article founded upon one piece of the Republican presidential nominee’s 1995 state tax return, Sanders on Tuesday said he wants to attack four provisions in the tax code that address how real estate losses are deducted.

The senator said he would “introduce legislation in the next session of Congress to fix our rigged tax system and close loopholes Donald Trump used to possibly avoid paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades.”

The four “loopholes” he cited are “the ability to use real estate losses to offset other income, to claim losses on real estate investments beyond what was invested, to avoid capital gains on property that was sold and to combine tax breaks on loan interest while taking deductions if the property depreciates,” The Hill reported.

The Times on Saturday wrote that Trump had claimed a loss of $916 million in 1995, which could have allowed him to avoid paying taxes for the next 18 years.

“Special tax breaks and loopholes in a corrupt tax code enable billionaires and powerful corporations to avoid paying their fair share of taxes while sticking the burden on the middle class,” said Sanders, whose candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination was founded on denunciations of the rich.

“It’s time to create a tax system which is fair and which asks the wealthy and powerful to start paying their fair share of taxes,” he said.

Sanders said the tax breaks used by Trump and others “do nothing to boost the economy.”

The Trump campaign has pointed out that the tax breaks allowed him to rebound and eventually hire tens of thousands of employees.

Although Trump has admitted using the tax code, he does not defend it.

“The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable,” Trump said Monday. “It’s something I’ve been talking about for a long time despite, frankly, being a big beneficiary of the law.”

However, a different side of the Trump tax story was being told by The Daily Caller, which unearthed a 1995 story from the Times with a very different tone from the newspaper’s critical coverage this past week. Twenty-two years ago, a Times article hailed Trump as “The Comeback Kid” for the business success and economic vibrancy he was bringing to New York City after years of hard times.

“Though there are still four years to go in the 90’s, business and government leaders in New York honored Donald J. Trump yesterday for pulling off what they called ‘the comeback of the decade,'” the article read.

“Mr. Trump, the developer who came to epitomize opulent wealth during the 80’s before tumbling into deep financial trouble, has managed to erase much of his debt and is moving ahead with major projects at a time other developers are idling,” it added.

“After the collapse of the real estate market of the 1980’s, Mr. Trump’s company was left holding some $8.8 billion in debt, causing his personal net worth to drop to a low of about $1 billion in the red by 1991,” the Times wrote.

“But since then, his fortunes have changed. He continues to pursue the trademark trophy-style projects he is known for,” it further wrote.
