Clinton Hid Past Health Problems From Public, Former White House Doctor Says.

Secrecy is not a stranger when it comes to Hillary Clinton’s health issues, the Democratic presidential candidate’s former doctor maintains.

Dr. Connie Mariano, who as a Navy captain was the White House physician in the administration of former President Bill Clinton and later retired from the service as a rear admiral, said that in 1998, Clinton allowed her staff and the general public to think that issues she had with her right leg were due to a pulled muscle and not a blood clot.

Mariano wrote a memoir of her time at the White House entitled The White House Doctor: My Patients Were Presidents.

According to her account, after examining Clinton’s leg, she insisted that the first lady go to Bethesda Naval Hospital for an ultrasound.

When Mariano’s diagnosis of a blood clot was confirmed, Clinton did not want to remain in the hospital, but was treated as an outpatient by taking blood-thinning drugs.

“Hillary was back on the campaign trail within days … very few people knew of Hillary’s blood clot at the time; she wrote about it after she left the White House,” the book said.

“She did have a pain in her calf but her staff thought she had pulled a muscle exercising,” Mariano wrote.

The treatment was kept very low key.

“I assigned a female nurse in civilian attire to accompany Hillary on the campaign trail,” Mariano wrote. “I also notified the Secret Service that she was on medication. In the event she was injured, excessive bleeding would be a dangerous complication.”

In her 2003 book, Living History, Clinton noted the clot’s existence.

After saying her right foot was “so swollen I could barely get my shoe on,” she was “whisked … off to Bethesda Naval Hospital” for tests.

“Sure enough I had a big clot behind my right knee that required immediate treatment,” Clinton wrote in 2003.

Clinton had another, potentially more serious, blood clot near her brain in 2013.
