Examining the U.N.'s Record on Urgent Global Challenges.

ABSTRACT.

An assessment of the organization's performance on refugees, war and peace, human rights, terrorism, gender equality and climate change.

FULL TEXT.

How well is the United Nations performing on the most vital global challenges of the past decade? We examine the organization's track record on refugees, war and peace, human rights, terrorism, gender equality and climate change, with experts offering their assessments.

Refugees.

Little Relief for Refugees: The refugee crisis is precisely the sort of issue the United Nations was made to tackle: a global problem crying out for a global solution.

A record 65 million people are displaced worldwide because of conflict, both within their countries and outside their borders.

The 1951 Refugee Convention, which most nations signed, obligates countries to offer protection to all those fleeing war and persecution.

Country after country flouts that treaty, and the United Nations has been unable to do much to compel countries to help.

In its relief efforts, the United Nations struggles to raise the money it needs to provide food, blankets and medicine to the ever-expanding number of people affected by conflict.

War and Peace.

Veto Power Impedes Peace Efforts: Eliminating "the scourge of war" is one of the original goals of the United Nations, and the Security Council is the arm of the organization with the mandate, and the tools, to prevent and end conflict.

In the face of some of the world's worst conflicts, the Council has proved to be ineffective, in large part because one or more of its veto-wielding permanent members have backed one warring party or another.

Mass atrocities continue in the Darfur region of Sudan as China and Russia support the government. In Yemen, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the West is implicated in the bombing of schools and hospitals. The Council's starkest recent failure has been over Syria, with Russia backing the government as the United States, Britain and France support some opposition groups.

The Council's considerable powers include sending in peacekeepers, and, today, about 100,000 soldiers and police officers are deployed to some of the world's worst battlefields.

But the United Nations faces a crisis about what its troops are willing and able to do.

And peacekeepers have sometimes been accused of hurting the civilians they were sent to protect, with claims of sexual abuse in the Central African Republic and failure to prevent a massacre in South Sudan. Perhaps most damaging, peacekeepers have been blamed for introducing cholera to Haiti, killing more than 10,000.

Human Rights.

Individual Rights Trumped by National Interests: The Human Rights Council is the United Nations body dedicated to taking action against countries that violate the rights of their citizens. But some of its members are countries that regularly violate those rights.

As with so much at the United Nations, the interests of member states trump everything else.

For instance, calls to establish a commission to investigate atrocities in Yemen, where a Saudi-led military coalition is battling ethnic Houthi insurgents, were rejected by the Human Rights Council in 2015. Saudi Arabia and its most powerful ally, the United States, are members of the rights council.

In 2009, the United Nations came under withering criticism for its failure to speak out on the widespread human rights violations at the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka. Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, vowed not to repeat that mistake and established a policy urging employees to report gross rights violations.

Terrorism.

Limited Tools to Fight Terrorism: The United Nations was set up at a time when conflicts erupted among nations, and peace was negotiated among them, too. As transnational terrorist groups have emerged as a pressing global problem, the United Nations has struggled to make a difference.

The Security Council has imposed sanctions on individual terrorists, freezing their assets and banning travel.

But there is no internationally accepted definition of terrorism, and not everyone agrees on who is a terrorist. India and Pakistan, for instance, spar over whether a leader of a Pakistan-based group called Lashkar-e-Taiba belongs on the sanctions list.

United Nations peacekeepers are not prepared for counterterrorism operations, though they occasionally find themselves in the thick of war zones where known terrorist groups are active. Troops with the peacekeeping mission in northern Mali, for instance, have frequently been targeted by insurgents affiliated with Al Qaeda.

Gender Equality.

The Gap Goes On: It was under Mr. Ban's watch that the General Assembly established U.N. Women, which is dedicated to promoting gender equality. He has championed lesbian and gay rights and extended benefits to gay couples. And in recent months, he said he backed the idea of a woman's succeeding him as secretary general.

That looks unlikely. Six women and six men vied for the post, but the front-runners at the moment are men. Mr. Ban's successor is to take over on Jan. 1.

Mr. Ban's record on promoting women's leadership has been mixed. He did appoint several women to key posts, but a vast majority of his senior appointments in 2015 went to men.

Climate Change.

Success on Signature Issue: Mr. Ban focused on climate change as a signature issue shortly after assuming his post. He went to see the melting ice in Greenland. He planted mangroves to guard against coastal erosion in the Pacific island nation of Kiribati.

His greatest legacy stands to be an agreement that the nations of the world reached in Paris in December to curb carbon emissions. Much of the impetus for the deal came from China and the United States, the world's two biggest polluters, which together vowed to stave off the worst effects of climate change.

It showed that the United Nations can come up with global solutions to global problems - but only when the world's most powerful countries let it.
