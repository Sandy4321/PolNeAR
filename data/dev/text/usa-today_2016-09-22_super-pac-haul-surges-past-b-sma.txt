Super PAC haul surges past $1B; 
Small group of rich donors pushes tally beyond total for 2012.

Super PAC donations have barreled past the $1billion mark, driven by a small group of super-wealthy contributors intent on deciding who will occupy the White House and control Congress next year.

Donations to super PACs hit nearly $1.1 billion through the end of August, a USA TODAY analysis of newly filed campaign-finance reports shows. That surpasses the $846.8million that poured into these groups during the entire 2012 election cycle, the first presidential race in which super PACs operated.

Nearly half the money -- $500.8 million --  in this election came from 62 individuals, companies and unions that gave $3million or more apiece.

More is on the way.

The top super PAC donors of the 2012 election, billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have just begun to spend, directing a combined $20 million last month to a super PAC working to preserve the Republicans' narrow majority in the Senate. Another $20 million in Adelson money is headed to a House-focused super PAC.

Adelson is joining forces with TD Ameritrade founder J. Joe Ricketts to help fund Future45, a super PAC that intends to hammer Democrat Hillary Clinton with negative ads, mailers and phone calls. Adelson has committed $5 million, and the Ricketts family will donate $1million.

Its first national television ad could start this week, said Brian Baker, a longtime political adviser to the Ricketts family who oversees the super PAC's last-minute campaign to stop Clinton.

Why the last-minute push? "This is the period of time when voters are making up their minds," Baker said. "Future45 intends to educate voters about Secretary Clinton's record."

Democrats are spending heavily, too. A USA TODAY analysis of super PACs that have raised $1million or more since Jan. 1, 2015, shows Democratic groups outpacing Republicans in recent weeks. In August, Democratic-aligned super PACs raised $64.8million to $45.1million that went to Republican groups.

Two Democrats, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer and hedge-fund manager S. Donald Sussman, top the list of mega-donors, contributing more than $38million and $23 million, respectively. Steyer announced plans this week to give an additional $15 million to For Our Future, a super PAC he formed with labor groups  to get out Millennial voters. That brings his commitment to the group to $20 million.

Super PACs, first authorized by court rulings in 2010, can raise unlimited sums from corporations, individuals and trade groups, then use that money to elect or defeat candidates. Their presence in everything from presidential races to school board contests has the potential to give some of the wealthiest people enormous influence in elections.

USA TODAY's super PAC tally doesn't include money raised by presidential candidates nor the tens of millions flowing into races from politically active non-profit groups that don't disclose their fundraising on a regular basis.

Clinton pledged to push for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision that helped pave the way for super PACs. But Democratic donors use the system to boost her campaign. In August, powered by more than $23million in contributions, the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action became the best-funded super PAC of the 2016 election. In all, it has pulled in $133 million.
