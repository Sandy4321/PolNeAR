Clinton Breaks With Obama On 9/11 Lawsuit Bill.

As President Obama appears set to veto legislation that would allow 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton apparently disagrees with her former boss.

According to Yahoo News, Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said Friday that if his candidate were to win in November, “she would sign this legislation if it came to her desk.”

Following an outcry from 9/11 victims’ groups, the bill, known as the “Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act” was passed by Congress with wide support.

The legislation would end the immunity foreign countries have from civil suits in U.S. courts, with actions allowed to be brought only if the country involved was determined to have been involved in a terror attack against the United States.

However, over the past few days, the Obama administration has promised a veto and attempted to make the case to members of both parties that the bill is a bad idea.

The White House has said it believes the legislation could result in retaliatory measures, where other countries would change their laws that currently protect the United States from legal liabilities.

“If this bill were to enter into force, if the president’s veto were overridden, the United States government, U.S. service members, U.S. diplomats, and even, potentially, U.S. companies are at risk of being hauled into court in countries all around the world,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

The attempt to stop the legislation has also included members of the Saudi government, which has strongly denied any involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks.

This has not gone over well with family members of 9/11 victims, many of whom say the president’s claims about potential retaliation from other foreign governments are unfounded.

“The president’s rationales to veto JASTA don’t hold weight. They are 100 percent wrong,” said 9/11 widow Terry Strada.

She continued, “For us, the 9/11 families and survivors, all we are asking for is an opportunity to have our case heard in a courtroom. Denying us justice is un-American.”

Strada accused the Saudi government of attempting to intimidate the 9/11 families and asserted that she and the other family members of 9/11 victims are tired of waiting for what they perceive as justice.

“Neither the president nor Congress nor lobbyists for foreign kingdoms should be permitted to make us wait another day to pass JASTA,” she said.

Obama’s veto is expected to come before the deadline at midnight Friday, but Republicans seem confident they votes necessary to override him.

“Our assumption is that the veto will be overridden,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., despite admitting that he did have his concerns about “trial lawyers trying to get rich” and general “legal matters” that could be worrisome, the victims “do need to have their day in court” and he does believe McConnell is correct about being able to override the president.

“I do think the votes are there for the override,” he said.

McConnell and Ryan remain confident despite a few early supporters of the bill, such as senator Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., now saying they think it should be changed to make it more difficult for families to sue and for the U.S. itself to be sued.

If the president does follow through on his veto threat and the veto is overridden, it would be the first time in his presidency that Congress would have successfully overridden an Obama veto.
