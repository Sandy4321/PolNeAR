Only 24 Percent of Hillary Clinton’s Contributors Are Small Donors.

Less than a quarter of Hillary Clinton’s campaign donors are small-dollar donors who pitch in $200 or less.

The New York Times reports:

"In an illustration of the lack of enthusiasm for her among some liberal activists, just 24 percent of the contributors to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign so far have given $200 or less. In 2012, 43 percent of the money to Mr. Obama was from contributors who gave $200 or less, and this year 58 percent of the giving to Mr. Sanders’s grass-roots bid came from small-dollar donors.

"Without this online network, Mrs. Clinton is being made to continue with an aggressive calendar of fund-raisers with rich donors as Election Day grows near — events that can limit her time in swing states and reinforce concerns that give rank-and-file Democrats pause."

Hillary Clinton has gotten into some trouble at high-dollar events with rich donors. At a recent fundraising gig in New York with celebrity Barbra Streisand, Clinton called half of Donald Trump’s supporters “deplorables.”
