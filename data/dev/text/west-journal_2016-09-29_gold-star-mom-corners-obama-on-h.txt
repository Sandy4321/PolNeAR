Gold Star Mom Corners Obama On His Refusal To Use The Words ‘Islamic Terrorist.’

President Barack Obama responded to a Gold Star mother Wednesday night by saying his refusal to use the words “Islamic terrorism” was a “manufactured” issue.

During a CNN town hall, Tina Houchins had a question for the president.

“As a Gold Star mother, my son gave his life for acts of terrorism,” she said. “Do you still believe that the acts of terrorism are done for the self-proclaimed Islamic religious motive? And if you do, why do you still refuse to use the term … Islamic terrorist?”

“The truth of the matter is that this is an issue that has been sort of manufactured,” the president said.

Obama said the words “lump” the good Muslims with the bad.

” … what I learned from listening to some of these Muslim families both in the United States and overseas is that when you start calling these organizations ‘Islamic terrorists,’ the way it’s heard, the way it’s received by our friends and allies around the world is that somehow Islam is terroristic,” he said.

“Do I think that if somebody uses the phrase ‘Islamic terrorism’ that it’s a huge deal? No,” said Obama. “There’s no doubt that these folks think that and claim that they’re speaking for Islam. But I don’t want to validate what they do.”

Obama said that because terrorists are Muslim does not mean Muslims are terrorists.

“If you had an organization that was going around killing and blowing people up and said, ‘We’re on the vanguard of Christianity, ‘ well I’m not, as a Christian, I’m not going to let them claim my religion and say, ‘You’re killing for Christ.’ I would say, ‘That’s ridiculous,'” the president added.

Obama said there is a danger when “a president, or people aspiring to become president, get loose with this language.”

CNN’s Jake Tapper then followed up with what appeared to be Obama’s clear reference to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but Obama said he was not speaking only about Trump.

Trump has used the phrase “Islamic terrorism” often in his campaign, and criticized Obama for not doing do.

In an August speech, Trump attacked “the hateful ideology of radical Islam – its oppression of women, gays, children, and nonbelievers.”

“We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, just as we have defeated every threat we have faced in every age before. But we will not defeat it with closed eyes, or silenced voices,” he said then.

“Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president,” Trump added.
