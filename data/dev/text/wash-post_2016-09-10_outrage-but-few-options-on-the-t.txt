Outrage, but few options on the table.

World leaders denounce N. Korea test; Obama, others vow consequences.

The United Nations Security Council on Friday made a strong condemnation of North Korea's latest nuclear test and pledged to impose further sanctions as a deterrence to what it called "a clear threat to international peace and security."

Following a swiftly called, late-afternoon meeting, the Security Council issued a statement calling the overnight nuclear test "a clear violation and in flagrant disregard" of five previous Security Council resolutions. The statement noted they had previously said they would take "further significant measures" if North Korea conducted another test.

"In line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin to work immediately on appropriate measures," they said, under Article 21 in the U.N. Charter that allows for sanctions and other nonmilitary forms of discipline.

The decision came just three days after the Security Council condemned North Korea's latest ballistics missile launch as Pyongyang fired three missiles into the sea Monday while the leaders of the G-20 group of world economies held a summit in China, which is North Korea's only ally and considered the only country that can reign in its neighbor.

World leaders and diplomats almost universally expressed outrage over North Korea's latest gambit.

The U.N., which in March imposed some of the harshest economic sanctions ever against North Korea, called an emergency meeting to discuss the test, which state news media claimed now allows Pyongyang to produce nuclear warheads small enough to attach to ballistic missiles. The latest test, North Korea said, was its biggest yet, although it may take several days to determine how powerful it was.

In a White House statement, President Obama condemned Friday's test as "provocative and destabilizing" and a "grave threat" to regional and international stability. He said the United States and its allies will seek new U.N. sanctions and take other measures "to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions."

"To be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state," he said.

Jean-Marc Ayrault, the foreign minister of France, a permanent member of the Security Council, said North Korea's latest "provocation cannot be left without consequences, especially at the U.N. Security Council."

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called a "brazen breach" of U.N. resolutions.

"I count on the Security Council to remain united and take appropriate action," he told reporters. "We must urgently break this accelerating spiral of escalation."

Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the United States would work with other Security Council members to take "robust steps" in response, and he urged North Korea to resume denuclearization talks it abandoned in 2009.

"We remain open to credible and authentic talks aimed at full and verifiable denuclearization of the DPRK," he said, referring to the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "Sadly, the DPRK has chosen a different path and made clear it would not be a credible negotiating partner."

Other leaders used particularly blunt language to denounce what Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called North Korea's "reckless, provocative, dangerous" actions.

South Korea accused the North's leader, Kim Jong Un, of "fanatic recklessness." South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Kim's mental state is "spiraling out of control."

Japan branded North Korea an "outlaw nation in the neighborhood." Russia insisted that Pyongyang "stop its dangerous escapades." The International Atomic Energy Agency said North Korea had displayed "complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community."

Even China, Pyongyang's only ally and its economic lifeline to the outside world, said it was "resolutely opposed" to the test and warned North Korea to refrain from further actions that would worsen the situation.

Although North Korea is not thought to be capable of delivering warheads to the U.S. mainland, it is considered a threat on U.S. troops in South Korea and Japan.

North Korea's fifth missile test, its second this year, reflects the stepped-up pace of its nuclear missile program. After a test in January, the Security Council imposed sweeping new sanctions that bar most trading with the regime for anything other than food, medicine and other humanitarian purposes. But the sanctions have done nothing to stop the government's determination to further its quest to develop ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. Nor is it clear that further sanctions would be a deterrent.

"The current sanctions-only approach, however tough, is simply not working, and continuing on that track is a recipe for even greater failure," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. "The next president, even before Inauguration Day, will have to have a strategy in place to try to effectively engage with the North to try to leverage the sanctions regime in place to achieve some restraint on North Korea's nuclear missile activities."

The latest test comes as several countries and institutions are on the cusp of transition. Ban, a diplomat from South Korea, will finish his term by the end of the year. South Korea will hold presidential elections next year. And U.S. elections are two months away.

Despite a number of failed missile tests this year, North Korea's nuclear ambitions have barely been mentioned in this year's U.S. presidential race. Experts on North Korea and nuclear nonproliferation said the latest nuclear test could change that.

"The U.N. has passed five Security Council resolutions and had a major General Assembly vote condemning North Korea for human rights abuses," said Victor Cha, a Korea scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "But the problem is, none of this is working. And whether it's Clinton or Trump, this is going to be the number one issue. There is no bigger security threat to the homeland than this."

Though it is difficult to assess North Korea's claims about the potency of its nuclear test, experts say it underscores the regime's determination to mass-produce warheads and eventually to deploy them on missiles in the field.

"If it doesn't have the capability to threaten its neighbors with nuclear weapons yet, it will at some point, probably sooner rather than later," said James Acton, a physicist who is co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "People disagree about whether there's any chance of threatening the continental United States at the moment. But the trajectory is clear."
