Ah, friends once more: Ted Cruz endorses Trump, who says he is honored.

Senator from Texas says he cannot allow Clinton to win the presidency.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) is endorsing Donald Trump's presidential campaign, the latest chapter in a rocky relationship between the two men that has ricocheted from fawning support to searing personal insults to, now, a kind of detente.

In a Facebook message posted Friday, Cruz said he has had "areas of significant disagreement" with Trump but cannot allow Hillary Clinton to become president.

"After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump," Cruz wrote.

The decision is politically risky for Cruz, who pointedly refused to endorse Trump during a prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention in July. Cruz exhorted Republicans to "vote your conscience" and said he was standing on truth and principle - ideologically pure stances that could be imperiled with his endorsement of Trump.

Cruz was booed off the stage, and his wife was filmed leaving early to avoid angry delegates. At a tense breakfast with the Texas delegation the following morning, Cruz said he wasn't going to "act like a servile puppy dog" and back Trump.

"No, this is not politics," Cruz said at the time. "I will tell the truth."

The truth, the senator said then, was that Trump had personally attacked his wife, Heidi, and his father, Rafael. Citing an unfounded conspiracy theory, Trump repeatedly accused Rafael Cruz, who was born and raised in Cuba, of associating with Lee Harvey Oswald around the time of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Trump also retweeted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz contrasted with a photo of Trump's wife, Melania, a former model.

"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father," Cruz said in July.

Delegates questioned how Cruz could turn back on a pledge he and other candidates made to support the Republican nominee.

"The day that was abrogated was the day this became personal," he said, adding he would never vote for Clinton.

Trump said after the convention he would not accept Cruz's endorsement if it were offered. But in a statement Friday, Trump said: "I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz. We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."

Cruz had been facing growing pressure from donors to back Trump after staying on the sidelines since the convention. Cruz is facing a reelection fight in 2018, and talk had been mounting about a Republican challenging him in the primary - chatter that may simmer down now that Cruz has endorsed Trump.

Over the past few days, Cruz and his aides increasingly signaled that they were coming around to Trump. On Wednesday, Cruz thanked Trump on Twitter for backing his top legislative priority - delaying a planned end to the U.S. government's role in managing a group that oversees Internet domain names. Trump this week also said he would consider naming Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of Cruz's closest allies in the Senate, to the Supreme Court.

The relationship between the two turned vicious during the primary after Trump questioned Cruz's eligibility to run for president because he was born in Canada. Cruz has long said that he qualifies as a natural-born citizen because his mother was born in Delaware.

The two men spent months lobbing pointed insults at one another. Cruz called Trump a "pathological liar" who is "utterly amoral," a "serial philanderer," a "bully" and a "narcissist at a level I don't think this country has ever seen."

Trump unloaded on Cruz in return, yoking him with the nickname "Lyin' Ted." Trump called the senator a "nasty guy," an "anchor baby," "unstable" and "sick."
