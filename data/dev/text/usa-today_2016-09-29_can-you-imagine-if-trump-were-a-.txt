Can you imagine if Trump were a woman?

Letters.

If Donald Trump were a woman would you still vote for her? Seriously, please ask yourself that question. Or would you think she must be the worst woman? Perhaps go a step further, and ask would you vote for an African American or Hispanic, man or woman, who said and did the same things as  Trump. The double standard applied to Trump is extraordinary.

Imagine that she:

Is the first presidential candidate in years to not release her tax returns. And openly lie that she can't because she is being audited.

Lacks even the basic understanding of foreign policy, and extols the virtues of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other dictators.

Filed for six bankruptcies, made millions while thousands of bond holders and small contractors lost fortunes.

Ran a fraudulent college business that bilked well-meaning people out of thousands of dollars.

Keeps saying she opposed the Iraq War, when there are radio clips of her supporting it.

Repeats racist and bigoted words about many people, and perpetuates long discounted conspiracy theories.

Preys on our worst fears and instincts, regarding Muslims and immigrants, and calls people "losers" and "sad."

Calls men derogatory names, like "pigs," and operates male beauty pageants.

Had three husbands, and a very public affair with the second before divorcing the first.

And if you would never vote for this woman, then why are you voting for Trump, unless simply because "she" is a "he"? A loud-mouthed, white "he." A man who has engaged in behavior so ignorant and reckless, we'd never tolerate it from a woman -- or a minority. So why do we tolerate it from this man? And how can that vote be justified to our wives and daughters, mothers and sisters?
