Laws don't apply equially to Clinton.

LETTERS.

I cannot fathom how Hillary Clinton has escaped charges for her mishandling of classified information thus far. It is apparent that Clinton wanted to shield her shady dealings and favors to foreign governments  from the U.S. public by having a private server, which she thought (foolishly) that only she would have access to.

This political decision by the FBI to not recommend any charges on all dubious actions, without even a slap on the wrist, destroys credibility and faith in our justice system. It sends a clear message that the "elites" in this country don't need to obey our laws -- only the ordinary people have to.

This does not bode well for America's future. When the law only applies to a certain segment of the population and not all citizens, we replace our democracy with a tyranny.

Will the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails ever stop? Her political career has been constantly investigated to no avail. She's done nothing wrong. I hope in 2017 America says, "President Clinton, thank you for a lifetime of public service."

Clinton's statements to the FBI don't really mean much because she was never sworn in to tell the truth. Not important enough, I guess. These procedings were just for show and entertainment value.

The FBI needs to stay out of this election process now unless it wants to release all its investigations. Play fair or don't play, boys. Now tell us this isn't a witch hunt of the highest order!

I'm not a Clinton fan, but enough with the emails! Who cares? Just a big distraction from the really important issues!
