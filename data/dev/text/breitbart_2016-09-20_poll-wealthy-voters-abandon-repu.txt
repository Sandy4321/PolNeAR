Poll: Wealthy Voters Abandon Republican Party for Hillary Clinton.

A Bloomberg poll shows that Americans living in households making $100,000 or more have abandoned the Republican party, led by Donald Trump, in favor of Hillary Clinton.

Clinton beats Trump by 46 percent to 42 percent, according to the poll. Twelve percent indicated that they were not sure.

Bloomberg reports that the Republican nominee has either won or tied among the group of voters making $100,000 or more, according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. According to exit polls, Mitt Romney had a ten-point lead over Obama among the high-earning group in 2012, but still lost the election.

The group also views President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and Paul Ryan more favorably than Donald Trump.

The survey was conducted September 16-19, using a nationally representative opt-in panel of 600 respondents. It has a margin of error +/- 4 percent.
