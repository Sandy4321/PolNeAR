Chris Christie Calls Hillary Clinton ‘A Disgrace’ Over Police Shooting Comments.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie described Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as a “disgrace” after she attacked law enforcement officers nationwide and blamed police shootings on “implicit bias” against minorities.

On The Steve Harvey Morning Show on Tuesday, Clinton criticized Tulsa, Okla., police officer Betty Shelby for shooting and killing Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old unarmed black man.

“How many times do we have to see this in our country? In Tulsa, an unarmed man with his hands in the air? I mean, this is just unbearable, and it needs to be intolerable,” she said.

Clinton also asserted she could speak directly to “white people” to prevent police officers from using lethal force when confronting armed or potentially dangerous black suspects.

“Maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people, say, ‘Look, this is not who we are.’ We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias,” she told Harvey.

Hours after Clinton’s appearance on Harvey’s program, mass protests in Charlotte, N.C., broke out — with many turning to looting and rioting — after Keith Lamont Scott, 43, was killed by police.

Scott, who was black, was shot and killed by a black police officer after he allegedly brandished a pistol during a run-in with officers.

Christie, who has campaigned heavily for GOP nominee Donald Trump since he suspended his own presidential campaign in February, blasted Clinton as a “disgrace” Wednesday on The Laura Ingraham Show.

“She’s a disgrace. She’s a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,” he said.

The governor added:

It’s typical of Hillary Clinton. She knows nothing, but the mouth never stops. And the fact is that she has no idea what happened in North Carolina. The same way, as you very aptly pointed out, Laura, people jumped to conclusions in Ferguson, which caused riot cautions in Ferguson, because of politicians dumping gasoline on a fire.

Clinton’s comments Tuesday on the shooting death of Crutcher came as the facts surrounding his death are still being gathered.

Crutcher was killed Friday after his vehicle came to a stop on the road near a busy intersection in Tulsa’s north side. Video of the incident shows him with his hands in the air in the moments before he was shot, but Shelby said he refused to follow her commands.

He was tased and then shot after he approached the driver’s side door of his vehicle. (WARNING: Video contains graphic images.)

Shelby later said she suspected Crutcher was under the influence of drugs — something a 911 caller also told a dispatcher before police arrived on scene.

The Tulsa Police Department revealed Tuesday the hallucinogen PCP, or angel dust, was found in Crutcher’s SUV.

This reporter was on the scene Tuesday for a protest of Crutcher’s death in downtown Tulsa.

Unlike demonstrations in Charlotte, the Tulsa protest remained peaceful.

Demonstrators said they want “justice for Terrence,” but pledged to remain civil.

Trump has also commented on Crutcher’s death.

On Wednesday, he told a crowd in Cleveland that he was “troubled” by the situation in Tulsa.

“This young officer, I don’t know what she was thinking,” he said. “I don’t know what she was thinking but I’m very, very troubled by that.”

Trump further described the incident as a “terrible situation,” but stopped short of calling Shelby’s actions racially motivated.
