Mary J. Blige sings to Hillary Clinton in preview clip of ‘The 411.’

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 28 (UPI) — In a preview clip for Mary J. Blige’s upcoming Apple Music show The 411, Blige sings Bruce Springsteen’s “American Skin” to Hillary Clinton.

“Promise mama you’ll keep your hands in sight,” Blige sings to Clinton before asking her, “I just want to know, where do we go from here?”

“American Skin (41 Shots)” was written by Springsteen after the 1999 shooting death of Guinea immigrant Amadou Diallo, who was shot at 41 times by four plain-clothes NYPD officers.

The clip has faced ridicule online since it was released on Tuesday.

The full interview will premiere on Sept. 30 on Apple Music.
