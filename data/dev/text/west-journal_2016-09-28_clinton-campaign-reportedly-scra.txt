Clinton Campaign Reportedly Scrambling For Black Voter Turnout In Florida.

According to a new report by Politico, Democratic party insiders are desperately trying to mobilize black Florida voters to go to the polls for Hillary Clinton on election day.

Florida, a swing state crucial to clinching a large number of electoral votes, will be inundated with Clintons later this week, as Clinton will host events in Broward and St. Lucie counties and former President Bill Clinton will travel to North Florida Friday.

According to Politico, both of these areas are highly populated with black voters.

In an effort to get out the black vote, earlier this month black mothers who have lost children to gun violence hosted a Clinton event in Jacksonville and a voter-registration drive in the largely black populated city of Opa-Locka, near Miami.

The efforts are expected to continue leading up to election day, with both President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle expected to visit the Sunshine state in the coming weeks.

Some believe the high level of priority being placed on motivating black voters in Florida shows the Clinton campaign is worried about its electoral chances in the state.

“Hillary Clinton’s campaign is in panic mode. Full panic mode,” said Leslie Wimes, a South Florida-based president of the Democratic African-American Women Caucus.

Wines believes that the Clinton campaign took black voters for granted and as a result, now has to scramble to convince them to come out and support her in November.

“They have a big problem because they thought Obama and Michelle saying, ‘Hey, go vote for Hillary’ would do it. But it’s not enough,” she said.

She added that most of the black vote in Florida seems more anti-Trump than pro-Clinton, which is a problem because, “In the end, we don’t vote against somebody. We vote for somebody.”

The Democratic nominee currently sits at 85 percent support among black voters in Florida, a 10 percent drop from the 95 percent Obama received in 2008 and 2012.

By contrast, Trump has just 5 percent support of the black vote in Florida, but has a wide majority of white support, which constitutes 65 percent of the state’s population.

It was clear Clinton is attempting to reach out to black voters at Monday’s presidential debate in her response to moderator Lester Holt’s question about race relations.

Clinton told the debate audience that she believes we must continue to push policies that help make up for racial divides in the United States, saying that “race still determines too much” in America, including how people are treated in regard to schools, housing and the justice system.

Still, the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton en masse among black voters seems to be a real issue for her campaign, as encapsulated by two first-name voters, Tyresha McClenney and Bryan Anderson, who saw Clinton’s running mate Tim Kaine speak at a recent rally.

McLenney said Clinton doesn’t show consistency in her concern for racial issues.

“It’s not something that she continuously says, it’s only like when the media gets a video of a black person getting shot,” she said.

She continued, “When the media dies down on that, and she’s still saying it … that would help have more trust in her and believe in what she says.”

Anderson largely agreed with McLenny and seemed to think the outreach to black voters was somewhat phony.

“A lot of her attempts to reach out come across as pandering,” he said.

While Obama had a wide array of black artists writing songs about him, that has not been happening for Clinton, which is something that concerns Henry Crespo, president of the Miami-based Florida Democratic Black Caucus.

“No one is writing songs for Hillary. Obama had will.i.am. Hillary has nobody like that,” he said.

“Right now, the vote is against Trump. It’s not for Hillary. I still think she’s going to win. But you want your people to be for your candidate, not just against the other guy.”
