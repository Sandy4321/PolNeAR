Popular Website Shows Bias When It Comes To ‘Fact-Checking’ Republicans.

Economic data and other factual information are crucial when it comes to helping a voter make an informed decision. On Monday, PolitiFact announced it will have 18 fact-checkers working during the first presidential debate, and it will all be done in real-time.

“The best way to follow along is by watching the live Twitter stream below, which will provide you fact-checks in near real-time starting at 9 p.m. E.T. by relying on our database of nearly 13,000 fact-checked claims,” PolitiFact says.

However, the “fact-checking” website has some issues with objectivity.

In a comparison done on Zero Hedge, similar statements made by former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican nominee Donald Trump regarding black youth unemployment were treated very differently by PolitiFact.

On July 6, 2015, Sanders made the following comment:

“For young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school, who are between the ages of 17 and 20, if they happen to be white, the unemployment rate is 33 percent.  If they are Hispanic, the unemployment rate is 36 percent. If they are African-American, the real unemployment rate for young people is 51 percent.“

When PolitiFact examined the senator’s statement, it was labeled “Mostly True.”

The bias begins to show when looking at how the website rated this statement by Trump on June 11:

“If you look at what’s going on in this country, African-American youth is an example: 59 percent unemployment rate; 59 percent.”

PolitiFact claimed “Trump exaggerates” the level of black youth unemployment through a “misleading use of statistics,” and concluded his comments were “Mostly False.“

The unemployment rate is a widely used term with a specific definition: It refers to the percentage of jobless people in the workforce who are actively seeking employment. In May, the unemployment rate for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 18.7 percent, or less than one-third of Trump’s claim.

Zero Hedge asked, “Wait, now it is 18.7% when Politi’fact’ said a year prior that Bernie’s 51% claim was ‘mostly true’? Interesting.”

The website noted that both Sanders and Trump were referring to studies that seek to find true unemployment rates by comparing the number of people employed to the total population adjusted for those still enrolled in continuing education. “On this basis,” Zero Hedge said, “true white youth unemployment is in the mid-30s while black youth unemployment is in the low-50s after hovering around 60% for several years.”

Republican National Committee Research Director Raj Shah said that statements made by Republicans are far more scrutinized than those of Democrats.

“Things that are not literally true are rated ‘correct’ because there was a kernel of truth. That’s not fact-checking, that’s opining,” Shah told InsideSources. “It seems as though whenever you find these inconsistencies they work against Republican favor.”

In 2013, research conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs found PolitiFact consistently rated Democrats higher in its fact-checking.

PolitiFact rated 32% of Republican claims as “false” or “pants on fire,” compared to 11% of Democratic claims – a 3 to 1 margin. Conversely, PolitiFact rated 22% of Democratic claims as “entirely true” compared to 11% of Republican claims – a 2 to 1 margin.
A majority of Democratic statements (54%) were rated as mostly or entirely true, compared to only 18% of Republican statements. Conversely, a majority of Republican statements (52%) were rated as mostly or entirely false, compared to only 24% of Democratic statements.

PolitiFact Executive Director Aaron Sharockman responded that the website cites so many Republican claims as inaccurate because they lack significant context.

“We’re not just validating numbers,” he told InsideSources. “We’re trying to provide context and look at the broader picture of how people will interpret that.”

PolitiFact is operated by the Tampa Bay Times, a Florida news organization with a liberal editorial bent.

During the primaries, the Times gave Clinton a glowing endorsement:

She has long been a persuasive advocate for women, minorities and middle-income families. She knows the gritty specifics of health care policy, and she gained extensive foreign policy experience as secretary of state. The former first lady and U.S. senator is a planner, a detail-oriented leader with refined positions that are not easily condensed into an applause line. She also has demonstrated her skill as a negotiator and as a determined advocate in all sorts of situations over a lifetime in the public eye.

Meanwhile, it attacked Trump, saying he “has offended Hispanics, women, the disabled and former prisoners of war with his insults and bombast, and he has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be an effective president.”
