It would go to the Senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place.”

I’ve said all along, this should have gone before a grand jury to take the politics out of this. This would not be a unique case to go before a grand jury, as I’ve done many times in the past. For whatever reason, they chose not to do that. I think there’s ample evidence with the probable cause to get the search warrant now to go before the grand jury and present this new evidence.”
