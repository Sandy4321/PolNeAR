T158	Discuss 7595 7733;7735 8211	On "The Breakfast Club" radio show Wednesday, Clinton was asked why she thinks the historic nature of her candidacy isn't resonating more. "I have tried to emphasize to people that, hey, just like President Obama was a really good president - and the fact that he was black, I think, was historic and unprecedented - but he also claimed and owned his excellence, and that's why I'm saying, 'Okay - I think it's really exciting and historic that I would be the first woman president, but I have a lot of work I want to do.' And I hope that people will say, 'Hey, she's getting it done.' That's how I think about it."
