Depending on who wins, the election was 'rigged.'

Letters.

For generations, the integrity of our electoral system has never been truly questioned. Free and fair elections are part of our history, the fabric of our nation.

I have served as an election official in three states over a period of 30 years. We have used paper ballots, punch ballots and electronic voting machines. We have been through recounts where our results have been spot on after close scrutiny.

For a candidate to believe that an election, yet to be held, is "rigged" is senseless and inflammatory. To refuse to accept the election results, no matter what they may be, is a call to revolt that can only create divisions deeper than we have now.

Unlike so many nations across the globe, our electoral system and its integrity have never been questioned. Donald Trump does no one any justice by questioning our system. Trump cannot accept defeat, if he can accept a revolution to pronounce him "president for life." He is the one who should be indicted for treason. The other candidate may not be perfect, but at least she can accept defeat as she did eight years ago.

Republicans should be talking to Al Gore for tips on surviving the questioning of an election result.

The "status quo" will be glad to see Donald Trump gone.

Our followers shared their thoughts on Wednesday's presdiential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

Clinton presented a vision of hope and national unity, while Trump presented a picture of darkness and division.

@Michelle_4681.

Trump won. He showed us he's the "change agent" and Clinton's more of the same.

@BLayton33.

Clinton was an A+. She was prepared, composed and ready to lead! Trump was the same old thing, no substance. He was a D at best.

@reba_sd.

Trump won. Clinton is just not honest and it shows. I don't think either is a great choice, but Trump supports more of my views.
