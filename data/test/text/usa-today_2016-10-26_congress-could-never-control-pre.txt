Congress could never control President Trump.

Donald Trump's small band of intellectual defenders can no longer claim that he is good man. Instead, they say his dishonesty and cruelty are acceptable because Congress could check him if he really got out of hand. Like so much else about the Trump campaign, this assertion rests on fantasy.

An unusual number of Republican lawmakers have come out against him, but most have not. Why are so many siding with a candidate who is so unfit? High on the list of probable motives is fear of a primary challenge.

If GOP lawmakers are cowering before candidate Trump, how could they stand up to President Trump? In addition to his wealth and political base, he would wield the vast power of the executive branch. There is little doubt that he'd use it to punish those who displease him. When House Speaker Paul Ryan said he'd no longer defend his bad behavior, Trump responded, "I would think that Ryan wouldn't be there."

In light of such threats, Republicans would hesitate to oppose Trump's choices for federal office or hold tough investigations into his management of the government. And it is hard to imagine that they'd reach for the ultimate weapon of impeachment.

Maybe congressional Republicans would suddenly get a miraculous infusion of courage and institutional fidelity. But I would not count on it. As Ryan acknowledges: "Under both parties, the presidency keeps breaking the rules, and Congress keeps allowing it to happen."

Even if lawmakers wanted to put some kind of restraint on a Trump administration, they'd have only limited ability to do so. They could turn down some of his legislative requests, but they'd have a hard time tracking what his administration was doing.

The feebleness of congressional oversight has been a problem even under a more-or-less normal person such as Barack Obama. It would be a disaster under a fanatically secretive person such as Trump. He won't release his tax returns, and he makes his campaign aides sign non-disclosure agreements. The mind boggles at the information that his administration would withhold.

Congress has always been at a disadvantage in checking the president's power over foreign policy and national security. Presidents have used military force hundreds of times without congressional approval. Congress passed the 1973 War Powers Act to curb this, but military actions by presidents have continued.

The law requires the president to seek congressional authorization within 60 days of starting military action. This requirement does not limit the president's power to launch a nuclear attack -- a process that would take less than an hour.

Trump probably does not hope for Armageddon. But it is all too plausible that his ignorance and rashness could start a crisis that escalates into a nuclear exchange. No one should vote for him in the hope that Congress could stay his hand -- because it can't.
