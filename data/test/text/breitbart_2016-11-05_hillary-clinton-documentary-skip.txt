Hillary Clinton Documentary Skips Collapse at 9/11 Ceremony.

The Clinton campaign has released a new documentary of her extremely long and exhausting presidential campaign, reminding supporters just how far they have come since she announced her campaign in April 2015.

The video includes highlights of testifying before the Benghazi committee lead by Trey Gowdy, her support of Black Lives Matter, her sleeping on the campaign plane with Bill Clinton, her Vice President Tim Kaine, hugs with her closest campaign aides, and the Democratic National convention. But the video omits any reference to the frightening moment in New York City when she fainted and was rushed into a van during the World Trade Center 9/11 memorial.

The video also includes several of her shots at Trump, including the shoulder jiggle, her debates, and, of course, another version of her campaign anthem Fight Song.
