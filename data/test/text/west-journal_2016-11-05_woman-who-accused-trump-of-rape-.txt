Woman Who Accused Trump Of Rape When She Was 13 Drops Her Claim.

Another claim bites the dust.

On Friday, the attorney for a woman who accused Donald Trump of raping her 22 years ago filed papers to drop her federal lawsuit against Trump.

That action followed by two days the woman’s cancellation of a press conference at which she was supposed to appear.

The woman has claimed that in 1994, while 13 and trying to advance her modeling career, she was raped after attending parties at the home of investor Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a registered sex offender in the wake of convictions in 2008 for prostitution. She later claimed Trump was among those who raped her.

Neither the woman nor her attorney could be reached for comment.

As with all allegations against him that were made during his campaign for president, Trump had flatly denied the woman’s allegations.

“It is categorically untrue. It is completely frivolous. It is baseless. It is irresponsible,” Trump attorney Alan Garten said.

“I won’t even discuss the merits because it gives it credibility that it doesn’t deserve.”

Garten noted that the lawsuit only appeared after Trump became a candidate.

“This is basically a sham lawsuit brought by someone who desires to impact the presidential election,” he said.

Trump’s candidacy has battled a spate of accusations of improper sexual behavior on Trump’s part, with the claims going back as far as 1980.

Trump has denied every allegation, and has promised to fight back once the election is over.

“Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication. The events never happened. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over,” Trump said last month.

“It was probably the (Democratic National Committee) and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with these fabricated stories,” he added.

“We’ll find out at a later date through litigation,” he said. “And I look so forward to it.”
