Keep the candidates honest, by all means.

LETTERS.

Those aspiring to high elected office and especially as a presidential candidate should have a fiduciary duty and responsibility to their future constituents and should be held to the highest standards of conduct and truthfulness.

If each candidate were to be under oath with the potential for perjury charges perhaps they would be more thoughtful and more careful in what they say during political debates. Of course any debate commission and the candidates would have to agree on the specifics of the rules.

Additionally, perhaps two fact checkers, one left and another right leaning, could be close to the stage during the debate. At the end of the debate each fact checker could pick out two or three of the most important inaccurate statements of the candidates and comment to the audience.

Hillary Clinton is going to win because people don't want a crazy man in the White House. It will be nice to see an arrogant, narcissistic jerk humbled.

David Randall.

America's choice is very clear at this point: Donald Trump. Clinton is like the old, badly damaged racehorse that her low-informed voters are still trying to ride.

Will Holliday.

Trump handed Clinton the White House with his bullying and lies. He's a sexual predator with no class, morals or education on world matters.

Rob Bigelow.

FBI Director James Comey is doing his job and Clinton didn't do hers properly. One point sticks with me here: All of my pals in government tell me they'd be in jail for what Clinton did. The no-work-email-outside-work-network rule should apply for the secretrary of State or anyone in government.
