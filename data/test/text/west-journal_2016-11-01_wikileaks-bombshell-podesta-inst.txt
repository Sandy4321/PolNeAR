Wikileaks Bombshell: Podesta Instructed Clinton Aide To ‘Dump All Those Emails.’

Wikileaks released yet another round of emails from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta Tuesday, and it included yet another bombshell.

A March 2, 2015 exchange between Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills has Podesta saying, “On another matter….and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner rather than later.”

The email, which seemingly shows intent if it is referring to the emails housed on Clinton’s private server, was sent out at the very same time as the New York Times’ initial report on Hillary Clinton’s private email server and just days before the former secretary of state’s press conference addressing the issue.

It is likely the “Lanny” referred to in the email is Lanny Davis, special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the president and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues.

Davis appears elsewhere in the Podesta emails, being brought up during an exchange between Clinton campaign communications director Robby Mook and Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the Podesta-Mills exchange about the emails, in which Mook appears unhappy with the attorney’s promise of transparency from the Democratic nominee.

“We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can’t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV,” he wrote.

It is still unknown if there are more details to come in future email dumps, but the exchange at least appears to be a deliberate attempt to mislead, which would negate Clinton’s story that she only deleted emails of a personal nature and instead was pursuing a strategy meant to obstruct the State Department and FBI investigation.

Clinton claimed at the time that she had turned over everything work-related, even attempting to make light of the thousands of emails she reportedly deleted.

When confronted at an August 2015 press conference by Fox News reporter Ed Henry about whether or not she “wiped” her server so the FBI could not recover certain emails, the Democratic nominee mockingly responded, “What? Like with a cloth or something?”

“I don’t know how it works digitally at all,” Clinton said at the time.

Another thread released last month appears to show that President Obama wasn’t being truthful when he initially claimed to have no knowledge of Clinton’s use of a private server while she was secretary of state.

An email sent out in the first week of March 2015 by Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri to Podesta indicates Obama not only knew, but actually emailed Clinton at the private address she was using.

“Suggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm,” she wrote, speaking of Clinton adviser Philippe Reines and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.

“I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet’s email addresses.”
