WikiLeaks Shows Desperate Plea For Help From Within The Clinton Campaign.

An email unearthed by WikiLeaks shows the desperation of a Clinton aide facing a dysfunctional campaign organization.

The email from Clinton aide and Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta asks in the subject line, “Is there something I can do” and continues in the body of the email to ask, “To get a grown up around Hillary?”

“I’m open to advice here,” Tanden added.

“This fall is going to be interesting,” Podesta replied.

Clinton is known for allowing only limited input, whether in office or on the campaign trail.

In the wake of the Sept. 11 incident in which her health forced her to leave a New York City ceremony, David Axelrod, President Barack Obama’s former chief campaign strategist, gave Clinton a dose of blame for the media furor that followed.

He said Clinton has “an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems.”

Axelrod had previously called out Clinton for her ways, tweeting in February that the candidate needed to take responsibility for things going wrong.

“When the exact same problems crop up in separate campaigns, with different staff, at what point do the principals say, “Hey, maybe it’s US?” he tweeted.

According to some sources, this pattern is nothing new.

“When she ran the Clinton administration’s health care project in 1993, the meetings were secret,” noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this summer.

“When she was under investigation for the Whitewater land deals, she resisted releasing the records. She still hasn’t released transcripts of her multimillion-dollar speeches to Wall Street bankers. … her private email server — operated out of the Clintons’ home in New York — is of a piece with the rest,” the Sentinel continued.

“Secrecy and transparency are always an issue for the Clintons, will always be an issue for her and probably are her main vulnerability,” said Matt Bai, a political columnist for Yahoo, who said the Clintons have always tried to keep their public image and private reality from colliding.

“The cumulative effect of that is a perception not unfounded in the public that there’s always a part of the Clintons that they’re holding back from you, that there’s always a more complicated reality than what they’re really telling you,” said Bai.

Other emails from WikiLeaks that have recently been unearthed show the Clinton was unable to easily walk about a stage during a 2009 speech.

“Just want to make sure someone has coordinated with you on hrc speech set up,” aide Huma Abedin wrote to some Clinton Global Initiative employees coordinating an event.

“She won’t be able to give it in the round like (Bill Clinton) does walking around with microphone,” she said. “Are we able to set it up so she’s speaking at a podium?”

When told the stage for that event was seating “in the round,” Abedin still wanted changes made.

“I’m worried that will be an issue for her. Can we do a half round or something?” she asked.

Another email noted that in September 2015, Clinton could not recall how she described herself politically. Tanden had been asking Clinton why she called herself a moderate.

“I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn’t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her,” Podesta replied.

In her response to that, Tanden noted, “It worries me more that she doesn’t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.”
