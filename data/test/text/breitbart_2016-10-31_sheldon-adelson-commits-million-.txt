Sheldon Adelson Commits $25 Million for Corruption Ads Targeting Clinton.

Billionaire Sheldon Adelson is reportedly committing at least $25 million to Future 45, a super PAC controlled by Joe and Marlene Ricketts.

According to Fox News’s Ed Henry, the money will be used to focus on corruption ads targeting Hillary Clinton in the final week ahead of the election on Nov. 8.

“It helps Republicans down ballot, but also is a sign big money Republicans who doubted Trump are now betting big as revelations from the FBI and WikiLeaks heat up,” Henry reports on Monday evening, noting that Trump and Adelson met in Las Vegas on Sunday.

“The $25 million from Adelson — it’s a floor, not a ceiling,” Henry adds.
