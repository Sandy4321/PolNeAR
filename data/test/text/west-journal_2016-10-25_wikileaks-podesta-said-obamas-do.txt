WikiLeaks: Podesta Said Obamas ‘Don’t Need To Be This Nice’ To President Bush And First Lady.

WikiLeaks has been relentless this election season with its release of tens of thousands of emails hacked from the account of John Podesta. Most of those emails have painted a picture of the ruthless, back-biting nature of Podesta in his time as chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

But the latest batch of Podesta emails to be leaked goes back to his work with Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008, including an email that suggests a strong dislike for outgoing President George W. Bush just after Obama had been elected.

The latest Podesta email to draw attention comes from a Nov. 10, 2008 discussion about Barack and Michelle Obama’s first visit with President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush after winning the 2008 presidential election.

Top staffers in the Obama campaign were discussing a statement thanking President Bush and the first lady for the invitation to the meeting at the White House.

In the email, Podesta said about Bush, “We don’t need to be this nice. He hasn’t done nearly enough although they seemed poised to finally do more.”

The staffers were also working on how to word a press release about the meeting and how to cite the work the outgoing president and first lady had started for getting the country out of the mortgage and housing crisis.

The email began, “President-elect Barack Obama and Mrs. Michelle Obama were very warmly received today at the White House by President George Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. Upon arriving, President-elect Obama and President Bush proceeded to the Oval Office, where they had a productive meeting that lasted for XX minutes. They had a broad discussion about the importance of working together throughout the transition of government in light of the nation’s many critical economic and security challenges.”

In the draft of the thank you, they had written, “Finally, the President-Elect praised President Bush for his administration’s work on the housing crisis and encouraged the President to try to identify further steps, using existing authority, to help struggling homeowners restructure their mortgages and stay in their homes.”

Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs joined the email discussion and also questioned the need to be complimentary of Bush.

“Haven’t gotten read out from Obama but not sure how much we want to praise bush on the housing stuff,” Gibbs said. “We certainly didn’t do that in the campaign.”

The latest emails from Podesta released by WikiLeaks range from early October to early November of 2008.

Another email leaked from Podesta’s account during that same time period has Podesta strongly advising Obama against attending a G-20 economic summit with Bush, for fear that it might make the incoming president appear supportive of Bush policies.

Podesta was the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and co-director of Obama’s transition team prior to the start of his administration.
