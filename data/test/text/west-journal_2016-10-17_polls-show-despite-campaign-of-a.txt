Polls Show Despite Campaign of Allegations, Trump Still Running Strong.

Although a week of allegations may have left Donald Trump battered, he remains in a tight race with Hillary Clinton, according to recent polls.

On Oct. 7, Trump was hit with the release of a 2005 video which showed him talking in a demeaning and lewd way about women. Although a strong showing at the Oct. 9 second presidential debate offset some of the damage, Trump’s campaign has been putting out fires in recent days after a spate of female accusers emerged, claiming Trump had acted inappropriately with them, or had made unwanted sexual advances.

Trump has denied the claims, and suggested they are phantom allegations created by the Clinton campaign and the media to prevent him from winning the election.

Some new polls show that while the allegations have dented Trump’s progress, he remains within striking distance of Clinton.

The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Daybreak tracking poll, which tracks Americans’ support for the presidential candidates on a daily basis, has Trump leading Clinton 44.8 percent to 43.7 percent. Trump lost about one point and Clinton gained one over the past week.

On Monday, a Rasmussen Reports poll showed Clinton leading Trump 43 percent to 41 percent among likely voters. Trump has a two-point lead in the same poll the week before.

A Washington Post-ABC News poll also showed Clinton leading 47 percent to 43 percent, which is unchanged from before the onslaught of accusers emerged.

“I think what’s happening is this is a highly contested election, and it’s going to be fought all the way to the finish,” Trump running mate Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana told Fox News Sunday.

Trump also remains difficult to dislodge in key battleground states.

Sunday’s NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey gave Trump a one-point lead in Ohio.
