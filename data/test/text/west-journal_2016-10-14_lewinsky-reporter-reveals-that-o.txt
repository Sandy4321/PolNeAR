Lewinsky Reporter Reveals That Originally Aired Broaddrick Video Was Edited.

Michael Isikoff, the reporter who is credited with uncovering the sexual indiscretions of former President Bill Clinton with intern Monica Lewinsky has now called for NBC to release the “unedited” version of the interview given by Juanita Broaddrick in 1999.

Isikoff told Sidewire on Thursday that the video which originally ran had been edited to conceal the fact that Hillary Clinton was aware of the rape allegation.

He also said the former first lady was instrumental in repressing Broaddrick’s claim that Clinton raped her in 1978.

“NBC has the full tape of the original Lisa Myers interview. NBC ought to check its archive and run the full interview. (As long as they’re now culling their archives!),” Isikoff said.

Isikoff also commented that Myers confirmed Broaddrick’s assertion that the network omitted sections of the original video which cast the former secretary in a bad light.

Isikoff told Sidewire, “Folks have made much of the fact that her claim about the conversation she had with Hillary wasn’t in the interview that run. Broaddrick said it got cut out; Lisa Myers has since agreed Broaddrick said this then—and NBC chose to cut it out.”

He also called out the way in which the same Democrats who attacked Clinton’s accusers are now joining to embrace Donald Trump’s accusers.

In a recent interview with Breitbart, Broaddrick recounted the rape and incidents which took place after the rape.

Broaddrick said the crime occurred in a hotel room in Little Rock, Ark.

“I only weighed about 120 pounds at that time. He was a very large man,” Broaddrick said, “And I kept telling him, ‘No. I don’t want this at all.'”

In another interview, Broaddrick spoke about meeting she had with Hillary Clinton at a later date.

Broaddrick said she was approached by Clinton who took her by the arm and said, “I just want to thank you for everything you are doing for Bill’s campaign. And it’s so nice to meet you.”

As she started to leave, Broaddrick said Clinton again grabbed her by the arm and, in a low voice said, “Do you understand. Everything you do.”
