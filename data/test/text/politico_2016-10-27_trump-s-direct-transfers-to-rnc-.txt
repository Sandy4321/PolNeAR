Trump's direct transfers to RNC in October: $2.2 million.

The Republican National Committee received only a few million dollars from its fundraising agreement with Donald Trump this month, according to Federal Election Commission records.

The RNC's latest report to the FEC shows a $2.2 million transfer on Oct. 14 from Trump Victory, the committee's joint fundraising arrangement with the Trump campaign.

The GOP nominee isn't planning any more high-dollar events that raise money for the party, Trump's national finance chairman, Steve Mnuchin, told The Washington Post earlier this week. Trump Victory continued to hold fundraising events this month, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said.

The victory fund lets the campaign collect larger checks and share the proceeds with the RNC and state parties. The arrangement directed $38.9 million to the RNC and $10.9 million to GOP state parties as of Sept. 30, FEC records show.

Trump Victory also sent $341,560 to the New York Republican Party on Oct. 17, $494,260 to the California GOP on Oct. 17 and $507,347 to the Missouri Republican Party on Oct. 19, and those parties made transfers in the same amounts to the RNC on Oct. 19. The joint fundraising committee also transferred $877,804 on Oct. 6 to the Arkansas GOP, which then passed along $365,116 to the RNC on Oct. 19. While Trump Victory is required to distribute the money it raises according to a formula agreed with all the participating committees, the RNC and state parties are allowed unlimited transfers among themselves.

The Trump campaign is unusually reliant on the RNC and state parties for its ground operations, and the drop-off this month could starve the organizations of fresh cash at a time when they typically provide phone banks and direct mail that are crucial to getting voters to the polls in the final stretch.

The RNC has its own fundraising, but the joint committees with the presidential nominees are typically a main source of money up and down the ballot.

Some Republicans abandoned Trump over the release of the 2005 recording in which he bragged about groping women, and the nominee has clashed with party leaders from Speaker Paul Ryan to the chairman of the state party in the key battleground of Ohio.

This story has been corrected. An earlier version said the RNC did not receive any money directly from Trump Victory. POLITICO regrets the error.
