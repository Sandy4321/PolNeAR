Daughter Of Eric Garner Blasts Clinton After WikiLeaks Reveals Effort To Use His Death For Political Gain.

The daughter of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, sent out a series of scathing tweets Thursday targeted at Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign after WikiLeaks released an email showing Clinton had wanted to use her father’s death for political purposes.

“I’m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed ‘using’ Eric Garner … Why would you want to ‘use’ my dad?” Erica Garner said. She also sent out links to the WikiLeaks email.

The email to which Garner was referring, which was sent by Clinton’s traveling press secretary, Nick Merrill, was in regard to a gun violence op-ed from March.

Merrill wrote: “I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don’t want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece.”

“Eric Garner not included because not killed by gun violence,” Clinton staffer Maya Harris replied.

“That’s a pretty good point,” Merrill replied.

Garner responded to these revelations with a profanity-laden tweet.

“I’m glad you had Maya on your team to explain why you wont be USING my dad in you f—— gun violence piece… Black woman saved your a—,” Garner wrote, adding, “These people will co opt anything to push their agenda. Police violence is not the same as gun violence.”

Garner endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary, but has recently shown support for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

Garner’s father died on July 17, 2014, after he resisted arrest for selling illegal loose cigarettes on Staten Island, N.Y. Officer Daniel Pantaleo applied a chokehold to take Garner down, and he died a short time later.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced on Monday she was appointing Justice Department investigators to take over a civil rights probe after they failed to find criminal charges to file against Pantaleo.
