Sen. Warren asks Obama to fire SEC chief, a longtime nemesis.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren called on President Obama to replace the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, the latest sign that the Massachusetts Democrat is positioning herself to become a major player in how Wall Street is regulated during the next administration.

In a letter to Obama, Warren called SEC Chair Mary Jo White the "biggest barrier" to progress on a push to force corporations to disclose their political spending. She said that White "has refused to develop a political spending disclosure rule despite her clear authority to do so."

"Enough is enough," Warren said to Obama, adding, "I respectfully urge you to exercise your unilateral authority under [federal law] to immediately designate another SEC commissioner as Chair of the agency."

The SEC declined to comment on the letter. White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said,  "The president continues to believe that Chair White is the right leader for the Securities and Exchange Commission."

Financial industry insiders say the move by Warren is a sign of the power the liberal arm of the Democratic Party could play in Congress next year. "She has just become so powerful.  ... It opens so many possibilities," said an industry lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely.

Warren's populist following has made her a feared figure in Wall Street circles. She has supported Take on Wall Street, a coalition of more than 20 labor unions and activist groups that has launched a  campaign to reform the financial industry. Her name was turned into a verb after she called on Wells Fargo's chief executive to resign in a particularly brutal exchange last month.

"You've already been Warrened before I had my opportunity," Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) said during a House Financial Services Committee hearing the following week. "So I'm not going to Warren you."

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was careful to court her during the primaries. Hacked emails of Clinton campaign aides disseminated by WikiLeaks suggest that Clinton considered modifying her stance on some financial regulation issues to avoid running afoul of Warren, and that Clinton's team worked to assure Warren they would consider her advice on key regulatory appointments.

Warren has been battling White for years, but the letter is by far her most direct attack.

In January, Warren issued a report arguing that U.S. companies get away with crimes that regular people don't because of weak enforcement. The SEC "is particularly feeble, often failing to use the full range of its enforcement toolbox," the report said.

In June, Warren and White faced off during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.

"A year ago I called your leadership at the SEC extremely disappointing," Warren said. "Today, I am more disappointed than ever."

White said: "I'm disappointed in your disappointment."

Obama appointed White, a former federal prosecutor, in 2013. The agency had long suffered under criticism that it was slow to root out corporate wrongdoing. But in the years since, the SEC has been swallowed by the task of implementing dozens of rules called for under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law and the 2012 JOBS Act, which aims to make it easier for small businesses to raise money.

The 4,000-person agency has repeatedly tussled with Congress, while scrambling to keep up with the technological changes that have overtaken Wall Street. Senate Democrats, including Warren, have blocked the nomination of two SEC commissioners.

White has defended the agency's performance, noting the myriad new regulations put in place to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The agency also has charged 89 senior executives and more than 100 companies with financial-crisis-era misdeeds, she said in an interview earlier this year. "The SEC has been quite aggressive and successful in that space," she has said, "but I also understand the frustration."

This time the clash between Warren and White is over whether publicly traded companies should be required to disclose their political donations.

Investor groups argue that such companies should not be allowed to spend shareholders' money on political campaigns without disclosing it. The data would shed light on the companies' political connections, they say.

But business groups and Republicans say a company's political contributions are not related to its financial performance and that the disclosures are unnecessary.

The SEC received a record number of public comments on the topic, more than 1 million, but did not act. It dropped the issue from its priority list in 2013.

Warren said in her letter to Obama that while demoting White would be an "uncommon act, Chair White's extraordinary, ongoing efforts to undermine the agency's central mission make such a step necessary."

It is  unclear whether Democrats will regain control of the Senate next year, but if Obama acts now, progressive members of the party could push to replace White with a more liberal member of the commission, said Bart Naylor, financial policy advocate for Public Citizen. "It would avoid a big Senate fight."
