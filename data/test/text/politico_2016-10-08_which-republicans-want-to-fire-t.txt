Which Republicans want to fire Trump?

An explosive report that Donald Trump once made a series of demeaning sexual comments about women, bragging about groping them, is prompting an unprecedented number of Republicans to rebuke their own presidential nominee, condemning him Saturday in harsh terms.

His campaign reeling and Republicans in panic as the revelations threaten to be the fatal blow to their bid to retake the White House, some are even demanding that Trump drop out of the race and let his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, assume his place at the top of the ticket.

The comments, made in a private conversation in 2005 and caught by a hot microphone before the Washington Post published them on Friday, do not mark the first time Trump has drawn criticism for his history of making inflammatory statements targeting groups of people. But they have clearly struck a new chord among major players in the GOP.

Here are the prominent Republicans who have condemned Trump’s remarks, from those who simply criticized them to those who rescinded their endorsements and others who want to remove him as the party’s nominee.

Some of them had endorsed Trump before Friday, while others never had.
