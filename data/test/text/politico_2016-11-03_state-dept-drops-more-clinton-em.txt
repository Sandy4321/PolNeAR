State Dept. drops more Clinton emails recovered from her server.

The State Department on Thursday dropped more than 1,000 additional pages of Hillary Clinton’s emails that the FBI recovered from her private server, but a significant number of the documents are near duplicates of messages the agency previously released.

State has been reviewing and publicly posting the emails in response to a pair of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and will likely continue to do so after Election Day.

The releases, however, have paled in comparison with WikiLeaks’ daily drops of messages hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s private account, some of which have proved embarrassing for the campaign, and the surprise announcement last week from FBI Director James Comey that the agency is reviewing more evidence in its probe of Clinton’s server.

Clinton’s campaign has sharply criticized Comey’s decision to publicize the move just 11 days before the election, with the former secretary of state calling the move “deeply troubling.”

The State Department’s release on Thursday, which included roughly 1,250 pages, was the third of its kind since the FBI handed over the emails it managed to pull from Clinton’s server.

As with past releases, the new documents included messages between Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin, often dealing with State Department logistics. In one exchange, they debated what kind of travel to arrange for Clinton to go to the Hamptons (Abedin wrote that Clinton had cut a vacation short for business, so she was “comfortable asking plane to take you there. We will pay for personal leg”).

In another, Abedin informed Clinton that an actor, whose name was redacted, had requested visa help (“he wanted us to open our embassy in london on a sunday to get a visa but we compromised and he will come in tuesday morning,” Abedin wrote, “so situation is under control”).

Clinton also exchanged several messages with her daughter, Chelsea, who used the alias “Diane Reynolds” in her email address. Clinton passed along feedback for Chelsea after speaking engagements or events she hosted, such as one in Kiev, which John Tefft, then U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, praised.

Clinton also forwarded Chelsea a message with a request she often made to Abedin: “Pls print.”

The department plans to publicly post a few hundred more pages on Friday, the last such drop before Election Day.
