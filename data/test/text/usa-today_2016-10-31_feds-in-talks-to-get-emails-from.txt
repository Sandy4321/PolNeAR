Feds in talks to get emails from laptop used by Huma Abedin.

Federal authorities are in discussions with representatives of longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin to get permission to search a computer Abedin used so agents can review newly discovered emails that may be related to the previously closed investigation of Clinton's handling of classified information, an official familiar with the matter said Sunday.

The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said discussions have been underway to secure approval for the review of the laptop used by both Abedin and her estranged husband, former representative Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y. The questionable emails first surfaced in a separate investigation of Weiner's sexually charged contacts with a 15-year-old girl.

The laptop was seized during that inquiry.

NBC News and ABC News both reported Sunday that the FBI had obtained a warrant to search the emails on Weiner's computer that relate to the probe of Clinton's server.

The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that there may be up to 650,000 emails on the laptop, but it is unclear how many may be relevant to the Clinton email server investigation.

FBI Director James Comey announced Friday that the bureau had uncovered emails that may be related to the FBI probe of Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of State. Comey had announced in July that while Clinton had mishandled classified information on her private email, he would not recommend criminal charges against her.

Democrats were outraged by Comey's announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing more emails, saying that he provided so little detail as to open the door to an array of conspiracy theories. Attorney General Loretta Lynch had urged Comey not to announce the new review, saying it violated the Justice Department's policy of not interfering in elections.
