The Latest: FBI ready to respond to Election Day crimes.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT):

12:50 p.m.

The Justice Department and FBI say they will have officials ready on Election Day to respond to potential crimes.

Justice Department officials will be monitoring conduct at certain polling places, and lawyers will be available to handle complaints regarding voter intimidation, discrimination and fraud such as vote-buying.

The FBI will also have a command center to monitor potential security threats related to the election. U.S. intelligence officials have warned of Russian efforts to use hacking to interfere with the election process.

The Justice Department has already warned that it will have fewer observers at the polls than in 2012 because of a Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.

The exact number of observers will not be revealed until closer to Election Day.

Donald Trump is slamming President Barack Obama’s decision to re-open relations with Cuba, saying “it’s always a bad deal with Obama.”

Trump did not offer specific criticisms during a Tuesday meeting with Cuban supporters at his golf course just outside Miami.

He listened and nodded along as a pair of women recounted the injustices they suffered at the hands of Cuba’s government.

Trump reversed his own position on Cuba during a September visit to Miami, which has a sizable Cuban-American population.

He had previously supported the decision to reopen diplomatic relations with the island nation. But he now believes the United States “needs to strike a better deal” and has vowed to scrap Obama’s efforts.

Hillary Clinton’s big donors aren’t letting up on the gas even as some recent polls show her pulling away from her Republican opponent, Donald Trump.

Priorities USA, the main pro-Clinton super political action committee, says it raised $18 million in the first few weeks of October. That’s about $1 million a day.

In all, Priorities has raised about $175 million to help Clinton. During the run-up to President Barack Obama’s re-election, Priorities collected about $75 million.

Super PACs can raise and spend money to promote a candidate, but can’t coordinate with the candidate’s campaign.

All super PACs and the candidates’ own campaigns are due to file finance reports with the Federal Election Commission by midnight Thursday. Those are the last reports before Election Day, Nov. 8.

Donald Trump is saying the high cost of Obamacare is hurting employees at one of his golf clubs. But the club manager later clarified that most workers won’t be affected.

Trump appeared Tuesday with employees at the Trump National Doral club outside Miami to tout his ability to create jobs.

The Republican nominee seized on news that average premiums under the Affordable Care Act will jump by 25 percent in popular plans before taxpayer subsidies kick in.

Trump said “all of my employees are having tremendous problem with Obamacare.” That implied he was not providing his employees health insurance.

The club’s general manager, David Feder, later said that “more than 95 percent” of the club’s employees are on company-provided insurance, with the only exceptions being some part-time and seasonal workers.

Donald Trump is appearing with the employees at one of his Florida golf courses – and they are offering testimonials to the boss.

Several dozen employees at Trump National Doral just outside Miami stood with the Republican nominee as he boasted about the golf course and said that 80 percent of his workers were of Hispanic origin.

Insisting it wasn’t rehearsed, Trump invited employees to the microphone to offer their support.

One put on a “Make America Great Again” cap. Another said he supported Trump, though his family did not. And a bartender said she “loved” working for Trump.

Trump has frequently mixed his campaign and business interests as he touts his ability to create jobs. On Wednesday, he will attend the official opening of his new hotel in Washington.

About 1.6 million Floridians have already voted in this year’s crucial election.

New numbers released Tuesday by the state Division of Elections show nearly 300,000 voters went to early voting sites Monday, the first day it was offered in 50 counties. Another 1.3 million voters have mailed in ballots.

Florida is a battleground state and the start of early voting has prompted Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton to sweep through the state.

Trump is holding rallies Tuesday in Sanford and Tallahassee, while Clinton will hold a rally in Coconut Creek.

So far Republicans have a slight edge in early voting. Numbers show more than 665,000 Republicans have cast ballots compared to more than 658,000 Democrats. Nearly 251,000 voters with no party affiliation have voted.

Jay Z will hold a concert for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland just days before Election Day.

The Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign says the hip-hop artist will perform on Nov. 4. He’ll also be joined onstage by special guests.

Jay Z campaigned for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Jennifer Lopez, Jon Bon Jovi and Katy Perry are also among the stars staging shows for Clinton in the next two weeks.

Lopez will appear in Miami on Saturday to encourage Florida voters to back Clinton. Bon Jovi will headline concerts in Pittsburgh on Thursday and in Tampa, Florida, on Nov. 5. And Perry will perform in Philadelphia on Nov. 5.

Even as his path to the presidency narrows, a defiant Donald Trump is insisting he is “winning” and urging his supporters to defy what he is calling an establishment conspiracy to deny the White House to his populist movement.

Trump, in the middle of a three-day swing through battleground Florida as thousands began voting there in person, hammered the “disgusting” media on Monday for its “phony polls” that he claimed were the latest signs of a “rigged election.”

“The media isn’t just against me. They’re against all of you,” Trump told cheering supporters in St. Augustine. “They’re against what we represent.”

“I believe we’re actually winning,” he said.

But even as Trump publicly displayed his trademark bravado, his team conceded publicly as well as privately that he was trailing — and that crucial Pennsylvania may be slipping away to Democrat Hillary Clinton. That would leave him only a razor-thin pathway to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House on Nov. 8.
