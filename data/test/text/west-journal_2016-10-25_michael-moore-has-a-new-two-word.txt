Michael Moore Has A New Two-Word Insult For Trump Supporters.

Controversial liberal filmmaker Michael Moore has not made a secret of his disdain for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and those who support him.

While sitting down for an interview with Rolling Stone, Moore took the rhetoric to another level by referring to those supporting Trump as “legal terrorists.”

When asked if this included any Trump supporter Moore said, “Any.”

He went on to say, “Legally, you have a right to vote on November 8th. You can go in there and even though you’re not necessarily in favor of Trump and you don’t like him that much and you know he’s a little crazy, you also know he’s going to blow up the system. The system that took your job and house away from you. You get to get back at the system now and blow it up and this is the only day you can do it legally. He’s told everybody that’s what he’s going to do. He’s the outsider who is going to ride into town and blow up the old way. So you, as a voter, get to participate in the detonation. He’s going to get a lot of votes from people who actually just want to sit back and watch the thing blow up.”

Moore launched what he called his own “October Surprise” last week when he rolled out his latest film, Michael Moore in Trumpland. The surprise element was the fact the director never made anyone aware he was even making the film until the day before it was released.

“It’s better that I’m quiet when I’m working because there are many forces who are standing by to try and thwart my every move,” he said for the reasoning behind the secrecy of the project.

As for the timing of the project’s release, Moore said he felt supporters of Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton appeared too confident in Clinton’s ability to win the election.

Moore said he felt they were saying, “We’re safe now. It’s over,” adding, “And this wasn’t the time to relax. This was the time to double and triple up in terms of what needed to be done. I didn’t see that happening.”

Moore also said he decided to make the film because he did not trust polls that showed Clinton with a comfortable lead over Trump, because they are subject to change.

Moore noted a poll in which the results are close means the actual outcome could go either way.

Moore also called Trump’s remarks during the final debate concerning his hesitancy to concede the election, should Clinton win, the “typical language of a bully.”

According to Moore, the overwhelming interest in the election is due to Trump and his unpredictable nature.

“Take Trump out of it and there would never be these ratings,” Moore said.
