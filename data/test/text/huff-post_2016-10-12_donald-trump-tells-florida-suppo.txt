Donald Trump Tells Florida Supporters The Wrong Date For Election Day.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told supporters in Florida on Tuesday evening that the election is on Nov. 28 ― 20 days after Election Day.
“Go register,” Trump implored. “Make sure you go out and vote Nov. 28.”

Yep, really.
To be clear, the election is Nov. 8.
Trump may have confused Election Day and the fact that the election is 28 days away as of Tuesday.
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.
