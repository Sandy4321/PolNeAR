As Paris climate pact takes effect, world's leaders tangle with a long to-do list.

A major milestone in global climate-change diplomacy was reached Friday when the Paris climate agreement, an international accord forged in December by countries across the world, became a legal reality, an achievement that came far sooner than almost anyone anticipated.

Next week in Marrakesh, Morocco, leaders from around the globe will begin ironing out the details of how individual countries will live up to the ambitious commitments they've made to slash their emissions of carbon dioxide.

When it comes to efforts to combat climate change, "it's the best of times, it's the worst of times," said David Sandalow of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.

World leaders have moved with unprecedented speed to combat global warming: In addition to the Paris accord, there has been progress this year on limiting international airline emissions and powerful greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons.

But most scientists agree that the efforts are not enough.

The current pledges countries have made under the Paris agreement would still allow the world to warm by 3 degrees Celsius or more above preindustrial levels, an amount well beyond the 2-degree threshold that many experts agree is likely to trigger severe changes to the environment. This year has offered grim reminders of an already changing climate, from extensive coral death at the Great Barrier Reef to particularly sharp Arctic temperatures in a year virtually certain to become the warmest in recorded history.

As the Paris agreement goes into effect, the world faces a sort of race between politics and physics. The central question that will hover over the international meeting in Morocco is whether humans can wean themselves from fossil fuels and halt carbon emissions in time to stave off the worst effects of a changing climate.

William K. Reilly, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush and has served as president of the World Wildlife Fund, said one key challenge for countries will be to identify precisely how they plan to meet - and eventually exceed - their commitments. Another is figuring out how to fund the kinds of energy transformations that will be necessary to stay "well below" the 2-degree Celsius temperature red line laid out under the Paris agreement.

"One has to hope that the engines are gearing up to ensure that those financings, which are absolutely necessary to the success of the Paris agreement, are forthcoming," Reilly said.

"We're going to really need to develop these green financing mechanisms," said Heidi Cullen, chief scientist for the nonprofit environmental organization Climate Central, adding that it will require a mixture of public and private investment. "It's going to take actors from every level, from every sector," she said. "It's far from where we are now. But we've managed to make tremendous progress."

The to-do list for Marrakesh is long. "The parties are going to roll up their sleeves and lay out the key issues in the fine print of the agreement that need to be ironed out so the architecture has meaning," said Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, who is co-leading the World Wildlife Fund's delegation. Only in 2018, at the earliest, will a future meeting focus on ramping up pressure for more ambitious commitments.

That's cutting it uncomfortably close, in light of a U.N. Environment Program report released Thursday suggesting that if the planet's overall emissions don't peak and begin to come back down by 2020, it may no longer be possible to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a goal particularly desired by developing countries and vulnerable small island nations.

None of this factors in the upcoming U.S. election. While Hillary Clinton has vowed to honor the Paris agreement and make sure the United States continues to play a leading role in combating climate change, Donald Trump has pledged to "cancel" the accord. That might technically be difficult to do, given that the agreement will already be in force in January, but a Trump administration could slow the political momentum for cutting carbon emissions. And such a move would reverberate in the global community that has rallied behind the Paris process.

"We have a choice between a strong leader on climate action and a climate denier," Sandalow said. "The choice between Secretary Clinton and Donald Trump will make an enormous difference for the future of the planet."
