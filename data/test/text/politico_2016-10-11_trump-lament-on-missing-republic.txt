Trump lament on missing Republican supporters:  ‘Why aren't they on the shows?'

Republicans have gone missing, Donald Trump suggested at a private fundraiser Tuesday, musing why they aren’t “all over the place.”

“I think they forgot that there was an election, because something happened in the last month where you didn't see them, right?” Trump said at a San Antonio fundraiser, according to audio obtained by the Texas Tribune. “You didn’t see them. I said, ‘Why aren't they on the shows? Why aren’t they all over the place?’”

Trump spoke for about 15 minutes, echoing his Twitter account with more attacks on the party. Trump told donors that “our own party gets in the way” of his White House bid.

“Sometimes it’s harder to beat our own party than it is to beat the person on the other side,” he said.

He also maintained that House Speaker Paul Ryan should focus on the budget, not criticizing his party’s nominee, and mocked him for losing in 2012 alongside then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

“This guy lost four years ago,” he said, “in like a landslide.”

Trump has repeatedly hammered Ryan and the GOP more broadly. In a series of Twitter posts, Trump lamented how difficult it is to succeed “when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!”

He called Ryan a “very weak and ineffective leader” and boasted about how “nice” it is now “that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.”

“It feels so good,” he told donors.

In his earlier tweetstorm, Trump also slammed other establishment Republicans, who he said are “far” less loyal than Democrats are to one another and “far more difficult than Crooked Hillary” because they “come at you from all sides.” “They don’t know how to win – I will teach them!” he tweeted.
