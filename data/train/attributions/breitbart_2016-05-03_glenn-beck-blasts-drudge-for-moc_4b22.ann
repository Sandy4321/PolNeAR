I asked for America to fast and pray and approach the Lord with humility and ask for His forgiveness and His protection. And it is being mocked in the media as usual. But I’m telling you, I don’t know who we are if this is not an American thing to be able to beseech the Almighty Creator – the one who gave us these rights in the first place and through Divine Providence established this country. I don’t know who we are.”
