T23	Content 832 1054;1056 1543	Seriously, seriously about this. Bernie says he’s going to pay for the free tuitions at all the great state universities with something called a tax on Wall Street speculation. That sounds great. We’ll screw the bad guys." But then I ask the people, ‘What do you mean by a tax on Wall Street speculation?’ They said, ‘Well, every time you buy or trade $100 worth of stock, you pay 50 cents or whatever,’ right? So all of a sudden, your 401(k), your mutual fund, everything your grandparents have invested in is now getting taxed as you go in the door. ... That doesn’t sound like Wall Street speculation. It just sounds like taxing anybody that’s going into the equity markets. That sounds like a lot of taxing

T43	Content 2166 2475;2476 2653	Here’s the irony of our time: Everybody hates people who make money off money — captains of the universe, billionaires making money off of other people’s money. Yet everybody who retires and begins to want to save, everyone wants better than the interest rate. And they want somebody who can do that for them. To be clear, a disproportionate share of any taxes on securities trades would be paid by the super-rich. The top 0.1 percent of earners took in half of all capital gains in 2011
