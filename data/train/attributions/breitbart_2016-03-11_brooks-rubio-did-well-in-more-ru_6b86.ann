It was more uplifting” and Rubio was hurt by going “personally, just in the gutter” against fellow candidate Donald Trump on Friday’s “PBS NewsHour.”

And I think there’s some evidence for Rubio to that effect. And so it was a more Rubio-style debate. And I thought he did well, because it was a substantive debate. It was more uplifting. And he did well, but not substantially well enough to change the nature of the race, I don’t think.”
