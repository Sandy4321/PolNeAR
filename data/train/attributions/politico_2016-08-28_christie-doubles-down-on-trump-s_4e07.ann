"When you have any folks in our population who live under the threat of violence, who live under the threat of crime, who don’t have the opportunity that others have because the schools in our urban areas are a dreaded failure, because of the positions that Hillary Clinton has taken and the people who support her, that I think any candidate should speak out to say that that type of thing is unacceptable,"

Asked about Trump's calling Hillary Clinton a bigot last week, Christie blamed Clinton for introducing charges of racism into the campaign. "The fact is that she’s been the person who started this type of conversation in the campaign," "She should be ashamed of herself."
