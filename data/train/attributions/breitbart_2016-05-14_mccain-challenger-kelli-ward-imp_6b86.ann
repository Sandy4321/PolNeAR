It’s about President Obama’s extreme vision of fundamentally transforming our nation, imposing political correctness, and pulverizing the rights of the states. "The latest example of this extreme overreach is Loretta Lynch suing North Carolina for its “Bathroom Bill,” which allows individual business owners, rather than government bureaucrats, to decide who can use which bathrooms. "The solution to transgender bathroom issues is not politics, but personal property. Let individual business owners make up their own minds. Either way, DC has no business in your business or your bathroom. Period. This is government gone wild. Loretta Lynch should be impeached for such outrageous overreach. "The Senate was supposed to be the guardian of the states, but after almost four decades in DC, John McCain has forgotten that. I’ll be a conservative champion for AZ, not DC. They have gone far enough. I’ll stop DC at the bathroom door."
