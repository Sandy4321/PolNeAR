T27	Content 696 1137	I came home from school and my parents were gone, and a neighbor came in and told me they had been taken away by Immigration. I knew what that meant, because we had lived in fear for so long that this day would come and then that fear came true. ... They were here undocumented. They overstayed their visas. They were fighting to find a path for citizenship ...  I mean, this is all they talked about, this is all we thought about every day.

T35	Content 1192 1974	No, no one did. No one checked up. No one called. It was as if I'd never existed. I called my friend's mother and we waited there to see what was going to happen, and nothing did. Even in school -- I kept attending the same high school and we thought for sure somebody was going to come and check up, and we had this whole thing planned about what we were going to say and hopefully I could stay in school and hopefully I wouldn't be taken away. And we were waiting to see if any of that happened, but no one ever did. So we just decided that maybe the safest thing for me at that time, was just -- if they didn't come knocking, I shouldn't say anything myself, so I just kept quiet and pretended nothing had happened. ... The parent of a friend -- she helped me and she took me in.

I wanted to use my voice but thought I couldn't, thought that no one could relate to me. I want them to know that there are so many people that can connect to them, and could help them, and if we band together, if we work together, and become politically active, we can make some changes.

He has them completely scared.  ... I don't know how you're going to round up 11 million people and deport them all. And I don't see how that can be good for our economy and certainly not for families and I just don't think it's a good thing.  ... It just puts fear in people that maybe they didn't have before about immigrants and about people who are undocumented, and then vice versa, if you tell people, 'We have to get these people out!'
