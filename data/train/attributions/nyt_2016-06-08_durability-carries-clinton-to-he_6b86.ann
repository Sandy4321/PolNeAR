T1	Discard 9845 9856;9858 9907;9909 10278;10280 10302	CORRECTION: As published in the International New York Times. Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday, about Hillary Clinton's path to becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee misidentified, in some editions, the political campaign that Roy M. Neel ran for Al Gore in 1992. He managed Mr. Gore's vice-presidential campaign that year, not his presidential campaign. (Mr. Gore did not run for the presidency in 1992.) Friday, June 10, 2016.
