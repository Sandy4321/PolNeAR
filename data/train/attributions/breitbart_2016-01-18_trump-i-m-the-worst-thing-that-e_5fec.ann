Now I’m like the worst thing that ever happened to the establishment because I understand the game. So now, they go to, let’s say, Jeb — they say Mr. President, this is very bad thing. I agree it is bad, we have to do this, we can’t allow this to happen. Then he is going to get a call from his lobbyist or his special interest, ‘Mr. President, they gave you $5 million. You can’t not make this deal’… Another one is going to call, Mr. President, they gave you $2 million. You’ve got to take care of Ford. Alright, I’ll do it. That’s the end. We lose the jobs and all the different things. With me, they’re going to equal.”
