T17	Content 1497 1666;1667 1838;1839 1895	“Should Rubio win Florida and Kasich win Ohio, it’s a near-certainty that no candidate will come close to getting the required number of delegates to win the nomination. Trump remains the only one with an even-marginally viable path, but he would need to win 69 percent of the remaining delegates after March 15 if he loses Ohio and Florida. Mathematically possible but practically very difficult.”
