There are multiple, complicated layers of history here, but Israel knows what’s clearly in its interest. Azerbaijan, petro-rich and perched on Iran’s border, is a useful friend—at least more so than tiny, land-locked Armenia.”

Unfortunately, hypocrisy is a small price to pay in exchange for military bases and petroleum,” It is, nonetheless, shortsighted of both states to adopt policies predicated on pursuing narrow and short-term interests. It is no surprise, therefore, that both powers have squandered their moral imperative, and find themselves isolated on the global stage more frequently.”
