T111	Discard 5787 5798;5800 5849;5851 6232;6234 6259	CORRECTION: As published in the International New York Times. An article on Thursday about a sharp drop in the value of Valeant Pharmaceutical International shares and the effect on a major investor, Pershing Square Capital Management, misstated the year Pershing Square's founder, William A. Ackman, first began to buy Valeant shares. It was 2015 - not 2014, which is the year Mr. Ackman teamed up with the company in a joint takeover effort. Saturday, March 19, 2016.
