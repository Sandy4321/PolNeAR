T19	Content 946 1327	I think this prophetic prayer timely, as at this time [late October], Iowa polls are showing a slipping of support for Mr. Trump among Evangelicals who prefer Dr. Carson to Mr. Trump 33% to 18%. I think it’s time evangelicals had a conversation about the criteria for office we are looking for. We want the most evangelical choice. But what we should ask is “who has God anointed?”

T34	Cue 1998 2063	elaborated on the message he felt the Lord was seeking to convey:
T35	Content 2065 2636	Cyrus his anointed? But Cyrus was not even a Jew. He was a foreigner. An outsider. But God raises up secular Kings and Rulers for the sake of His people. This was Churchill and Lincoln and even Reagan. God wants to keep the gates of heaven open over certain nations – hence Cyrus will see “gates that cannot keep closed.” The gates of Hell have plundered a lot of ground in America this past seven years. It’s time that the gates of Hell were plundered and things were restored in certain places. Heaven’s gates will open and Hell’s gates will not be able to stay locked.

As long as he’s fighting on the American side you can bet he’s fighting to win the war and distinguish himself as a great General. Anyone suspecting otherwise does not know Donald.
