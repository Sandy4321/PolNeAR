T15	Content 1707 2561	“Two weeks ago, [Trump’s] strongest territory had been the South. Now, it’s the Northeast….This week’s contest in Indiana is much different territory for Trump, though. He did well around Chicago, but otherwise the areas bordering the state have been as enthusiastic about Cruz and Kasich as they are about him. He leads in the polls, but it’s clear that Indiana will be a much tougher contest….A key thing to note from this is that there’s no strong correlation between any demographic point and the results of the 2016 election. This isn’t like the Democratic contest, where knowing the percentage of the population that’s black can give you a good sense of who will win. Figuring out the overlap of geography and economics and ideology at play on the GOP side is a lot more nuanced than that. Which is another reason that Indiana will be interesting.”

T19	Content 2924 3670	“We found that, across candidates, the leadership strengths most highly correlated with likelihood to vote for a given candidate were inspiring, cares about individuals, visionary and courageous...For example, the average percentage of those who give each candidate a high rating on competitive and also say they are highly likely to vote for that candidate is 29%...On the other hand, 53% of those who rate a candidate as high on the inspiring dimension also say they are highly likely to vote for that candidate….Overall, the conclusion is that ratings on the ‘softer,’ not necessarily campaign-related, dimensions are those that really seem to matter to Americans, or at the least are those most differentiating in terms of voting intentions.”

The biases on measures of volunteering and community problem-solving were very large, while those on political engagement were more modest...Online nonprobability survey vendors want to provide samples that are representative of the diversity  of the U.S. population, but one important question is whether the panelists who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups are representative of these groups more broadly. This study suggests they are not….researchers using online nonprobability samples are at risk of drawing erroneous conclusions about the effects associated with race and ethnicity.”

T39	Content 5894 6539	“In general, samples with more elaborate sampling and weighting procedures and longer field periods produced more accurate results. The less accurate samples tended to be selected (or ‘balanced’) only with respect to gender, age and region. The best performing samples, by contrast, were balanced not just on those characteristics but also on variables such as education and income….The limitations of this study’s design, however, make these conclusions preliminary at best. Our data come from just nine samples, none of which experimentally manipulated these design features. Consequently, the effects of those features are not well isolated.”
