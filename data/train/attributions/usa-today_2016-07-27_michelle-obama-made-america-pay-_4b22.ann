In this election, and every election, it is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives."

Michelle Obama was a close second. @srobbins2188. I loved them all, but I think Michelle Obama touched my heart. @donnamcd40. Sarah Silverman telling #BernieOrBust people they're being ridiculous. @ventytre. Michele talking about Hillary Clinton and her husband breaking down gender and racial barriers to become president. @JeffOstach. Michelle was a class act, touching and inspiring. But Cory Booker got the party going! @peacockhill.

Unfortunately, the Democrats couldn't find anyone to play the role of Sen. Ted Cruz in their convention. Republicans are still way ahead on dysfunctionality points. Kevin Hays. Got to give Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters credit. The lies from Sanders as he "endorses" Hillary Clinton do not fool them. Kristen Cooper. Like night and day compared with the Republican National Convention last week of doom and gloom. This week is positive. Bobba Luie. TWITTER.
