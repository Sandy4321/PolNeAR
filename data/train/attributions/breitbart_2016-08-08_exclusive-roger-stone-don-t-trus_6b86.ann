T11	Content 424 842;844 1207	“I think that the stakes are so high – and Donald Trump has made it pretty clear that if he is elected president he will seek the prosecution of Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea – that they would do anything necessary to remain in power. For anybody who thinks that election fraud is not common in this country, the voting machine today is merely a computer. And all computers can be rigged to have a predetermined outcome.” “… There is evidence that the Clintons not only cheated with the super-delegates, but in States like Wisconsin and New York and Kentucky there were charges of widespread voter fraud on behalf of Hillary. So it does happen here. It will happen here if this race is close. The big city machines, particularly Chicago, are very adept at manipulating these machines.”
