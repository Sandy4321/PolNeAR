I like transparency and accountability. I know Hillary does as well. She wants to bring accountability into government, particularly on foreign policy and national security. I think last night you saw she was very, very lucid who we can create stability in the Middle East as well as how do we keep America safe. I think she cares about openness and transparency. And I think she will release them at the appropriate time.”
