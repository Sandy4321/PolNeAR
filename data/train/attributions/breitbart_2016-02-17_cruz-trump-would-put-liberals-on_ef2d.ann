I’ll tell you this, if Donald Trump becomes president, we will see liberals on the court, and we will see our rights taken away. The 2nd Amendment will be effectively erased from the Bill of Rights. And sadly, I fear the same thing is true if Marco Rubio were to become president. Why do I say that? If you look at Republicans in the past, many of the worst judicial activists were put on by Republicans who didn’t want to take the political heat and fight to confirm a conservative.”
