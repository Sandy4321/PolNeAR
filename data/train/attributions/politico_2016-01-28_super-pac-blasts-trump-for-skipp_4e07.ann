T13	Content 1088 1346;607 994	"More and more, Trump appears to be the kind of politician voters fear the most. Donald Trump's decision to opt out of the next GOP debate is clearly an attempt to duck the issues we've raised and avoid the tough questions about his chameleon-like campaign." "This shocking new ad raises new questions - thanks to Donald Trump’s own words - about whether the voters of Iowa can trust him, even when he makes tough statements about his signature issue of immigration. Trump's entire campaign claims that he 'says it like it is,' yet we are finding that over and over, on core Republican issues, Trump says different things to different audiences,"
