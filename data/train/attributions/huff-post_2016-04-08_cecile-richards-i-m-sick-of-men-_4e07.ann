T3	Content 17 73;75 772	‘I’m Sick Of Men Telling Us What To Do With Our Bodies.’ "[Trump’s] comments were, one, outrageous and dangerous. I also though think it opened up a whole line of conversation which is important. Ted Cruz wants to ban all abortions in this country. John Kasich, the supposed moderate in this race, has signed 18 different bills in Ohio to end access to health care for women, including reproductive health care. So I think it is really important that people begin to face the logical conclusion, which is, if you make abortion illegal again in this country, then women who have abortions will be criminals, as will doctors and clinicians who provide them. And so I actually think Donald Trump unwittingly opened up a very important line of conversation."

I live in Midland and I had to drive 400 miles to access abortion services.’ So that’s actually the impact. But it’s far beyond abortion!... The majority of people who come to Planned Parenthood come for birth control or come for cancer screening.”
