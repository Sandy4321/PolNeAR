The club, founded in 1998 in a cramped space at the corner of Allen and Stanton Streets on the Lower East Side … moved to a more spacious room on Ludlow Street in 2003 but closed last year after being priced out of the neighborhood, Ms. Gilson and Mr. Rosenthal said. Late in 2014 it moved again, to an even bigger space in Williamsburg, where the club had a balcony and a rooftop bar — palatial digs compared to its first home — but it struggled to establish itself there." http://nyti.ms/1U0Xvbm. NOW OPEN—"Pop-up art show strives to confront South Bronx gentrification," by DNAinfo's Eddie Small: "Curators of a pop-up art show in the South Bronx are determined to confront the area's gentrification fears and avoid the accusations of insensitivity that have befallen several previous shows in the borough. The No Longer Empty Curatorial Lab, a program that the arts group No Longer Empty offers to help emerging art curators, recently set up an exhibit at 900 Grand Concourse called 'Intersecting Imaginaries' that centers on the theme of literal and conceptual mapping." http://dnain.fo/1NJeFcM. MOVING SHOP—"High-end contemporary art gallery opening across from Whitney Museum," by DNAinfo's Danielle Tcholakian: A high-end art gallery that represents street artists from around the world is relocating to a space across from the Whitney Museum. Allouche Gallery, formerly at 115 Spring St. in SoHo, signed a lease for a 5,125-square-foot ground floor retail space at 86 Gansevoort St. owned by TF Cornerstone. Cornerstone representatives said the relocation will draw Whitney visitors interested in perusing 'highbrow artwork' that they can buy." http://dnain.fo/1HTeElU. NEW YORK AT ITS CORE—"For City Museum’s new director, a job of balancing history with crowd-pleasers," by The Wall Street Journal's Jennifer Smith: "Ms. Donhauser, 48 years old, hasn’t previously led a museum. But she spent the past 23 years as a fundraiser and manager at one of the largest and wealthiest ones in the world, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, most recently as senior adviser to its president. In January, Ms. Donhauser will move some 20 blocks uptown to take the helm at the City Museum [which] aims to expand its audience with a splashy, multimillion-dollar exhibition on four centuries of New York City history. Set to open next fall, the long-term installation, 'New York at Its Core,' will take up the entire first floor of the museum’s building on Fifth Avenue between 103rd and 104th streets, where a $97 million renovation project under the current director, Susan Henshaw Jones, is drawing to a close." http://on.wsj.com/1lHHbkb. BROADWAY BEAT—"Matthew Morrison is leaving ‘Neverland,'" by Times' Michael Paulson: "Matthew Morrison, the star of 'Finding Neverland,' is leaving the Broadway musical next month. Mr. Morrison, who plays J.M. Barrie, the British playwright who wrote “Peter Pan,” has been with the show since it began previews in March. His contract is expiring; the show has not yet announced a replacement ... He is departing 'Finding Neverland' on Jan. 24, just five days after Kelsey Grammer, an actor famed for his role in 'Cheers,' returns to the cast in a dual role, as Captain Hook and the theater producer Charles Frohman." http://nyti.ms/1RHiWiu. —"‘Hamilton’ to play Chicago in long-term run starting in 2016," by Variety's Gordon Cox: "Ultrahot Broadway musical 'Hamilton' will ride its wave of hype and popularity all the way to Chicago, where a production of the show will begin a long-term run starting in the fall of 2016. The Windy City’s 'Hamilton' will mark the first step in the international rollout of the show, which on Broadway has become a megaselling celebrity magnet to which it’s nigh-impossible to score a ticket. If the musical expands in the way other Broadway smashes have, a West End staging is certain to follow, as well as a national tour." http://bit.ly/1Qz0RCt. —"Sam Mendes leaves ‘Chocolate Factory’ on its way to Broadway," by Times' Michael Paulson: "Sam Mendes is withdrawing as the director of the Broadway-bound musical 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' allowing the producing team free rein to rework the commercially successful but critically divisive show before it opens in New York. Mr. Mendes will remain a part of that producing team — his company, Neal Street Productions, is mounting the musical alongside Warner Bros. Theater Ventures and Langley Park Productions. The show has been running at the Theater Royal, Drury Lane, in London’s West End since 2013." http://nyti.ms/1RcZGKu. STAT OF THE WEEK: $43 million—the amount of money in subsidies the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved for News Corp. and 21st Century Fox to relocate from midtown Manhattan to lower Manhattan, Dana Rubinstein at POLITICO New York reports: http://politi.co/1NeJqEY. PSA—"You have until the end of December to get free museum and zoo memberships," by DNAinfo's Nicole Levy: "You have a few more weeks to snag free memberships to cultural institutions in all five boroughs when you sign up for an IDNYC card, the government-issued identification card available to all New Yorkers age 14 and up. Through Dec. 31, a new ID card will get you a free one-year membership to 33 institutions, including the New York Botanical Garden, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Hall of Science and the Staten Island Zoo. Membership packages offer such perks as invitations to special events, gift shop discounts and complimentary admission." http://dnain.fo/1HSB5rF. "Met accused of whitewashing baby Jesus," by Post's Kathianne Boniello: "A Manhattan man is suing the Met, claiming it’s committing sacrilege by depicting Jesus as a blond. 'Racist' paintings portraying Christ as an 'Aryan' male should be removed from the walls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Justin Renel Joseph argues in his Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit. The masterpieces are 'offensive aesthetic whitewashing' of the reality that the Savior, as a native of the Middle Eastern region, had 'black hair like wool and skin of bronze color,' says Joseph, 33, who is acting as his own lawyer." http://bit.ly/1N4Ghaw.
