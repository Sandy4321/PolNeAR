The candidate must: Meet the constitutional requirements for the office (that is, he or she is at least 35 years old and a natural born citizen). Appear on the ballot in enough states to have a chance at receiving a majority of votes in the electoral college. Do well enough in polls to "be realistically considered among the principal contenders" for president. Be recognized by other organizations as being among the principal contenders. Candidates who meet that threshold -- and the nominees of the major parties -- are eligible for transition services. Those include issue briefings, personnel management and security clearances for top campaign officials
