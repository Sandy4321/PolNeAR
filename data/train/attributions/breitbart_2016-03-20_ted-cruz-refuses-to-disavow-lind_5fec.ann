That’s the key to this problem An American is an idea. No group owns being an American. Nobody owns this. It’s an idea that’s unique to the planet and one of the center pieces of this idea is that you come here trying it knock it out of the park as a person… and the reason that I have gotten involved in this is because Sen. McCain started talking to me about it from an Arizona perspective and I want to than Sen. John McCain for being a leader [applause from La Raza group]. And I don’t do this much, but I want to thank Ted Kennedy because those two gentlemen got this thing started… Our immigration system is broken and we need to find a way to get people right with the law…we are going to solve this problem, we’re not going to run people down, we’re not going to scare them, we’re going to tell the bigots to shut up and we’re going to get this right."
