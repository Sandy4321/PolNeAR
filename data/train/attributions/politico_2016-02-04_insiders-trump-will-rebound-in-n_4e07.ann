Clinton’s organization had New Hampshire ‘locked up’ for months. New Hampshire’s Democratic federal delegation supports Clinton. New Hampshire’s Democratic governor, executive councilors and most state senators support Clinton. Clinton won the New Hampshire primary in 2008. Months ago, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews couldn’t get the New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman to acknowledge that Sen. Sanders was even a credible candidate amid the overwhelming local support and organization of Clinton.”
