Rush Limbaugh Explains The Democrats Opposition To A Sanders/Trump Debate.

Radio talk host Rush Limbaugh used his platform Friday to discuss what he described as the “brilliant” decision Donald Trump made to request a debate with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

Limbaugh began by crediting Trump for his instincts and urging him to keep following them.

“This is a testament to his instincts,” Limbaugh said. “I don’t know if he realizes how brilliant this proposed debate with Crazy Bernie is. And I think everybody is missing the reason why it’s brilliant.”

He went on to say that some Democrats, such as Joe Manchin and others, are mad at Sanders for agreeing to the debate. He said that one would think the reason people were uspet is that the debate would upstage Hillary Clinton.

Discounting this notion, Limbaugh said that with the delegates Clinton already had, the debate would not do much to upstage her.

He contends that Democrats are concerned because the debate with Trump would be held at a time when it could be seen by a large number of voters. This would give Sanders the type of exposure that he had previously not enjoyed.

Limbaugh accused the Democrats of scheduling their debates at times when no one would be watching them, such as Saturday evenings. He asserted that people are beginning to realize Sanders is gaining on Clinton, but they are unfamiliar with what he is saying. He blames mass media for their failure to adequately cover the Sanders campaign.

“And I’m here to tell you, folks, that the reason why there is such panic and palpable fear on the Democrat side that this may actually happen, they are afraid the public is going to end up seeing the real Democrat agenda, with the mask off and with no camouflage, if they put Bernie out there,” Limbaugh said.

He added that Clinton is better at camouflaging the party’s agenda, while Sanders was open and did not try to hide it.
