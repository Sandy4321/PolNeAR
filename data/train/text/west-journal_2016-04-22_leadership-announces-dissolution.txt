Leadership Announces Dissolution Of Secret Club For Hollywood Republicans.

For more than 10 years, conservatives in Hollywood have been privy to a secret club known as the Friends of Abe.

On Thursday, the dissolution of the club was announced. The abrupt announcement led some to speculate that disagreement over Donald Trump’s presidential campaign may have been partially to blame.

According to The Guardian, an email was sent from the club’s executive director, Jeremy Boreing, to the club members. The email said, “Effective immediately, we are going to begin to wind down the 501 c3 organization, bring the Sustaining Membership dues to an end, and do away with the costly infrastructure and the abespal.com website.”

The email went on to say, “Today, because we have been successful in creating a community that extends far beyond our events, people just don’t feel as much of a need to show up for every speaker or bar night, and fewer people pay the dues that help us maintain that large infrastructure.”

The organization of 1,500 members include celebrities such as Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammer and Jerry Bruckheimer.

Many members were surprised and dismayed at the loss of what they consider a refuge from Hollywood’s bullying liberal ethos.

Filmmaker Jack Marino said, “As a conservative, if you expressed your political views at work you would be weeded out. At Abe events we could get together over dinner and hang out with our own kind and speak freely.”

Boreing said the members will still meet for drinks and speakers, but said, “It’s time we change how we do it,” promising the Friends of Abe will return to its roots.

The club began in 2005 with celebrities such as Clint Eastwood, Gary Sinise and Patricia Heaton.

Members of the group, named after Abraham Lincoln, were sworn to secrecy with a line from the film Fight Club: The first rule of the Friends of Abe is you do not talk about the Friends of Abe.
