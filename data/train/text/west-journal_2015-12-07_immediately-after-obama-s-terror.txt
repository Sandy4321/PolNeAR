Immediately After Obama’s Terror Speech, Trump Said The 11 Words Everyone Was Thinking.

As President Barack Obama lectured the nation about Muslims and defended his record against ISIS on Sunday night, Donald Trump responded from the heart as he live-tweeted the president’s Oval Office address.

As Obama covered predictable ground, Trump noted that even in little things, the president was out of step with everyday Americans.

Noting that Obama’s policy has been to allow ISIS to continue to enrich itself off the profits of oil fields in the land it controls, Trump reminded Americans of his policy to cut off the source of ISIS’ wealth.

As the president meandered through his text, Trump railed at Obama’s refusal to cut to the heart of the issue.

Although Americans look to the president for leadership against ISIS, Obama spoke about the need for Americans to recognize the positive contributions of Muslims in America.

“Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling?” reacted Trump.

Earlier Sunday, Trump was critical of Obama’s leadership.

“We’re being led by people that don’t know what’s happening,” Trump said. “When you have President Obama talking about global warming is our biggest problem, we have a president that is just not with it at all.”

Trump said Sunday that he believed the United States would eventually win its fight against ISIS, but not until Obama “admits this is a problem.”

He noted that one of Obama’s weaknesses is his refusal to properly discuss the threat to America as “radical Islamic terrorism.”

“But he’s only going to be there, fortunately, a little bit more than a year,” Trump said. “Because the problem will get solved when he gets the hell out.”
