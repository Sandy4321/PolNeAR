Carly Fiorina Endorses Ted Cruz: I Am ‘Horrified’ By Donald Trump.

Carly Fiorina threw her support behind Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) Wednesday, saying it is time to have a “real constitutional conservative in the White House.”

Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who dropped her own presidential bid in early February, made a surprise appearance at Cruz’s rally in Miami Wednesday morning. She applauded him for defying the establishment and fighting for Americans’ liberties “over and over again.”

“Ted Cruz has stood up and fought for our right to bear arms. He has fought for our religious liberty. He has fought for our sovereignty. And he has won over and over and over,” she said to cheers.

Fiorina was upfront about her distaste for Donald Trump, the current GOP front-runner, saying conservatives need to band together to stop him.

“There are other people in our party who are actually kind of horrified by Donald Trump. I’m one of them,” she said. “But here’s the thing: We’re not going to beat Donald Trump by having leaders in our party tsk tsk over voters. We’re going to have to beat Donald Trump at the ballot box. And the only guy who can beat Donald Trump is Ted Cruz.”

She also compared Trump to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, saying they are both part of the system and therefore won’t do anything to reform it.

Despite his dislike for the establishment, Cruz is increasingly trying to encourage the establishment wing of his party that he is the best alternative to Trump. Cruz picked up a win in Idaho Tuesday night, while Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) failed to win any states. They are largely banking on winning their delegate-rich home states in upcoming contests.

Cruz still has not received any endorsements from his fellow senators.
