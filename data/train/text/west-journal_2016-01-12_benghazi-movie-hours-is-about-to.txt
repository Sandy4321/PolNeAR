Benghazi Movie ’13 Hours’ Is About To Come Out- But 2 Major Things NOT Included Have Everyone Talking.

The movie 13 Hours by famed director Michael Bay is set to be released this week.

13 Hours will cover the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, crisis in which a U.S. State Department compound and The Annex, a CIA station, were both attacked by Islamic terrorists.

Four Americans died as a result of the attacks.

Specifically, 13 Hours will tell the story of six American security operators who risked their lives to defend the compound after dozens of armed attackers poured into the compound.

The film is based on New York Times bestselling author Mitchell Zuckoff’s book, 13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi.

According to conservative columnist Hugh Hewitt, one notable feature of the movie is who it lacks: President Barack Obama and previous Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Hewitt writes:

The movie mentions neither the president nor the then secretary of state by name, and no expressed argument is made as to what the two did or didn’t do to assist their embattled ambassador, his staff, and the CIA Benghazi outpost on September 11th, 2012. But the overwhelming impression of the huge number of people certain to see the first big release of the year, will be that they did not do enough.
In fact, it will be that they did nothing at all. Nothing.

He writes in the column that the “movie is simply and completely an indictment.”

Zuckoff’s 13 Hours book, now made into a movie, is described on Amazon as a “riveting book” that “takes readers into the action-packed story of heroes who laid their lives on the line for one another, for their countrymen, and for their country.”
