Clinton to Planned Parenthood: Trump will reverse Roe v. Wade.

WASHINGTON, June 10 (UPI) — Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told a Planned Parenthood gathering in Washington she will protect reproductive rights while her opponent, Donald Trump, wants to “take America backward.”

Clinton spoke to the Planned Parenthood Action Network, her first campaign speech since becoming the presumptive nominee earlier this week. The friendly audience cheered Clinton’s attacks on Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.

“When Donald Trump says ‘Let’s make America great again,’ that is code for let’s take America backward, back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some,” Clinton said, referencing the period before 1972’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.

“Well, Donald, those days are over,” Clinton said.

Trump was scheduled to address a conference of evangelical leaders across town Friday.

Clinton attacked Trump, saying he would appoint Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade, and reminded the audience of comments Trump made — and later walked back — that, if he succeeded in criminalizing abortions, women who sought them should be punished.

Clinton also told the largely female audience bathed in neon pink lighting of Trump’s past descriptions of women he doesn’t like as “pigs, dogs and disgusting animals.”

“Donald Trump has shown us who he is and we sure should believe him,” Clinton said.
