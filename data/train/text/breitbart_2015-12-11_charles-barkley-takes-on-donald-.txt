Charles Barkley takes on Donald Trump, ‘loser’ supporters.

NEW YORK, Dec. 11 (UPI) — NBA on TNT has a crew of large former players with even bigger personalities.

So it was no surprise Thursday, when Charles Barkley went off script to comment on presidential candidate Donald Trump and his supporters.

“He started out by insulting Hispanics…now to lump all the Muslims together, that’s even more insulting,” Barkley said. “This is the United States of America, this is the greatest place in the world. Do we have issues? Of course we have issues. But to try to divide and conquer, which is what the Republicans always try to do, is just sad.”

“Then you have these losers who love that, because they’re afraid to look in the mirror and see why their life sucks. So they have to blame other people. Your life sucks because of you, not because of Hispanics.”

Barkley, who said he typically votes democratic, said one candidate he likes so far is Ohio Governor John Kasich. Barkley also said that CNN, a fellow Turner Broadcasting asset, has done an “awful” job of covering the “election.”

“CNN has done an awful job this election,” Barkley said. “They have followed ratings and sound bites this entire cycle. And I love CNN because they’re a part of our company, but they’ve been kissing butts and chasing ratings. They’ve become like Fox News.”

“And it’s become sad that our company has sold its soul for ratings.”
