St. Paul Votes To Condemn Donald Trump’s Muslim Ban.

The St. Paul City Council on Wednesday approved a resolution condemning Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.

The council voted 6-1 for the resolution which said the city “condemns anti-Muslim, anti-refugee, and anti-immigrant speech from presidential candidate Donald Trump and others.”

Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California by a Muslim couple.

One member voted against the resolution on free speech grounds.
