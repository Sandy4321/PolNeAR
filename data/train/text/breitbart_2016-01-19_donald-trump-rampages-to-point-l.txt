Donald Trump Rampages to +32 Point Lead in Florida.

According to a just-released poll from Florida Atlantic University broadcast on MSNBC, in a 12 person Republican primary, Donald Trump is blowing the pack away in Florida with an incredible +32 point lead. The billionaire businessman currently enjoys 48% support in the Sunshine State, a +12 point jump from November.

Trump’s closest competition is Senator Ted Cruz, who sits at just 16%.

Just as stunning is Marco Rubio’s collapse in his home state. The Florida Senator lost -7 points, and now sits at just 11%. Jeb Bush, a former two-term Florida governor, sits at just 10%.
