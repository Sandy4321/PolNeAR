Trump: Clinton should have congratulated me for making history.

Donald Trump said Friday that it would "have been cool" had Hillary Clinton congratulated him for doing something in the presidential election that nobody has ever done before.

“I was curious to see whether she’d do a class act and not mention my name,” the Republican nominee said at a rally with supporters in Colorado. “Or mention it with respect, like, say, ‘I’d like to congratulate my Republican opponent for having done something that nobody has ever done in the history of politics in this nation.’”

In the 2016 election, Trump beat a large field of 16 GOP candidates to clinch the nomination.

“See, I thought she might do something like that. I thought she'd give me a big fat beautiful congratulations. If she did that, would that have been cool? Would that have been great?,” Trump said.

Clinton spoke Thursday night after becoming the first woman in U.S. history to win a major party's presidential nomination.
