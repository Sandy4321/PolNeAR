Super PAC blasts Trump for skipping debate.

A conservative super PAC aimed at taking down Donald Trump is out with a new ad Thursday hitting him for skipping Thursday's GOP debate and for his stance on undocumented immigrants.

The ad, which is part of a $1 million Iowa buy from Our Principles PAC, starts out hitting Trump on the fact that he has declined to participate in Thursday night’s GOP debate and is instead hosting a competing event after a feud with Fox News. It will air beginning Friday on TV and online.

Our Principles PAC was started by a former top aide to Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.

"This shocking new ad raises new questions - thanks to Donald Trump’s own words - about whether the voters of Iowa can trust him, even when he makes tough statements about his signature issue of immigration. Trump's entire campaign claims that he 'says it like it is,' yet we are finding that over and over, on core Republican issues, Trump says different things to different audiences,"Katie Packer, who is chairman of Our Principles Pac said in a statement provided to POLITICO. "More and more, Trump appears to be the kind of politician voters fear the most. Donald Trump's decision to opt out of the next GOP debate is clearly an attempt to duck the issues we've raised and avoid the tough questions about his chameleon-like campaign."

“Donald Trump is skipping the last debate before the Iowa caucuses. Why? Trump can’t handle tough questions, like why he’d let millions of illegal immigrants stay in America and even supports a pathway to citizenship,” a voice over says as a photo of an empty podium is shown.

Source familiar with the ad says the group is spending “substantial” funds to air it. The super PAC has already spent over $1 million on TV and radio ads and mailers targeting Trump in the final days before Iowa and New Hampshire.

The ad then cuts to footage of Trump saying, “ you have to give them a path you have to make it possible for them to succeed. You have to do that.”

The ad also renews accusations Trump had used undocumented immigrants in the construction process for his sites.

The 60 second ad ends with a voice over saying: “Amnesty for illegal immigrants. Big money for himself. Can conservatives Trust Donald Trump?”

The ad’s focus is interesting as Trump has one of the toughest proposals on undocumented immigrants in the presidential field, which includes building a wall along the southern border and deporting millions.

Earlier this week Trump secured the endorsement of Arizona’s Sheriff Joe Arpaio who is known for his tough stance on undocumented immigrants.
