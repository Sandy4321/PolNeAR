Trump: My immigration plans aren't set in stone.

Donald Trump says parts of his immigration proposals are “negotiable,” but only minor details about his border wall.

In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Monday night, Trump responded to a question about a recent claim, first introduced by BuzzFeed earlier in the day, that he told The New York Times editorial board in an off-the-record tape-recorded meeting that he may not follow through with his proposed immigration measures if he is elected president.

“The New York Times is claiming today that they had an off-the-record conversation with you in January,” Hannity started.

“We had a board meeting, it was off-the-record, suddenly they leak it, it’s all over the place,” Trump said.

“They said it’s negotiable on the wall,” Hannity said in reference to Trump’s stance on Mexican immigration and his oft-stated promise to build a border wall.

“By the way it is negotiable. Things are negotiable,” Trump said. “I’ll make the wall 2 feet shorter or something.”

Trump was quick to add that the negotiation does not include nixing the idea altogether.

“Building it? Not negotiable.”

“Would it be negotiable about the 11 million?” Hannity pressed. “Maybe let some people stay if they register in a period of time?”

“I would say this,” Trump answered. “We will work out some system that’s fair, but we either have a country or we don’t. We need a border. We need a wall.”

Trump’s leading Republican rivals, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, have both urged the Manhattan mogul to release the audio tapes of his conversation with the Times from Jan 5. Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney tweeted his call that the billionaire front-runner share the contents of the recording.
