Third-party contenders are wild cards.

The new poll of voters in all 50 states revealed a variety of interesting dynamics across the country, including wide-ranging support for third-party candidates, the consistent role of Obama's popularity and how Utah may be the most interesting state to watch this election.

Johnson wins a slice.

Third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are positioned to garner significant support across the country in a year in which the major-party candidates have broken records for unpopularity. The Post-SurveyMonkey poll finds the Libertarian Party's Johnson supported by an average of 13 percent across all states, ranging from a low of 4 percent in Mississippi to a high of 25 percent in New Mexico, the state where he served two terms as governor.

Johnson's second-best showing comes in neighboring Utah, where the state's heavily Republican and Mormon electorate has been especially resistant to Trump. Johnson also fares well in several Midwest and Western states, receiving 19 percent support in South Dakota, Idaho and Alaska, 17 percent in Kansas and 16 percent in Colorado, Iowa, North Dakota and Washington.

The Green Party's Stein receives less support than Johnson, averaging 5 percent across all states in the new poll. Her best showing is 10 percent in Vermont, home to   Sen. Bernie Sanders, the runner-up for the Democratic nomination. She also receives 8 percent in Maine and 7 percent across a range of heavily Democratic or Republican states, including Oklahoma, Idaho, Oregon and California.

Utah is most uncertain state.

An average of 10 percent of registered voters reported "no opinion" when asked whether they would vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but the share of uncommitted voters is nearly twice as high in Utah at 19 percent, the most of any state. Even when third-party candidates are offered as options, Utah's 11 percent undecided is the most in the nation.

Utah has long been loyal to Republicans, supporting the party's presidential candidates by double digits in presidential contests for over four decades. But Trump came in third place in the state's Republican caucuses this March, earning only 14 percent of the vote. He performed particularly poorly in areas of the state with a larger share of Mormons, who account for a majority of the state's population, according to a 2015 Pew Research survey.

Trump is still a favorite to win the state, leading Clinton by 46 percent to 35 percent. His edge shrinks to 34-27 when third-party candidates are mentioned, with Johnson's significant 23 percent only four points below Clinton. Mitt Romney's 73-to-25 percent victory in 2012 marked Republicans' largest margin since President Ronald Reagan's 1984 run, with Romney probably benefiting from his leadership in the Mormon church. Compared with the 2008 race, while Clinton's current standing in a two-way contest is nearly identical to Obama's 34 percent support, Trump's support today is well below Sen. John McCain's 62 percent support that year.

Room on Obama's coattails?

Obama's approval rating has been above 50 percent in national polls, an above-average popularity that figures to benefit Clinton this fall. The Post-SurveyMonkey poll underscores the close connection between Obama's image and Clinton's fate this fall.

Across all 50 states, Obama averages 48 percent job approval, and Clinton's support against Trump differs from his rating by an average of only four percentage points. On average, Obama's approval rating is three points higher than Clinton's support, exceeding her support at least narrowly in 48 states. The two exceptions are strongly Republican Wyoming (Obama approval 26 percent, Clinton support 27 percent) and Arkansas, where Clinton served as the state's first lady and garners 41 percent support against Trump, compared with Obama's 36 percent job-approval mark.

Home state favoritism also appears to play a role in the state where Clinton falls short of Obama the most. In Obama's home state of Hawaii, his 70 percent job-approval rating far surpasses Clinton's support by 12 percentage points. The gap is smaller but more consequential in more politically divided Colorado, Florida, Michigan and Iowa, where Clinton's support falls four points short of Obama's approval mark.

While Clinton has not united all of Obama's supporters, Trump has even more work to do in galvanizing Obama opponents. His state-level support is six points below Obama's disapproval rating, on average, with sizable underperformance across many states. Obama's disapproval mark exceeds Trump's vote share by 13 points in Vermont, and by 11 points in Delaware. Among battlegrounds, Trump trails Obama's disapproval mark by eight points in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and by seven points in Ohio and Iowa.

Immigration lower-tier issue.

Trump's promises to deport undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border have put the issue of immigration at the center of this year's campaign, but the 50-state poll finds immigration is a second- or third-tier issue for voters across the country.

Asked which issue matters to them most, an average of 32 percent across all 50 states picked the economy and jobs, followed by health care and terrorism at 16 percent each, education at 10 percent and the environment at 8 percent. Immigration came fifth at 7 percent, exceeding only foreign policy at 4 percent.

The importance of immigration peaked in some states near and far from the U.S.-Mexico border, including 13 percent in North Dakota, 12 percent in Idaho, and 10 percent in Texas and in California. But in each of these states, immigration ranked behind the economy and terrorism.
