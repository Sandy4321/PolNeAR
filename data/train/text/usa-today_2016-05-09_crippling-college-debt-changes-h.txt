Crippling college debt changes how grads live; 
About 42 million borrowers bear $1.3 trillion loan burden.

For a short time, Vanessa Iampaglia considered selling her eggs to pay for college.

At $8,000 a pop, the invasive procedure would have helped with the $85,000 in loans she needed to pay for her education. But between classes and working 35-plus hours a week at multiple jobs, she didn't have time to drive to the doctor's office every day to get the injections required.

Even without the egg donation, the Point Pleasant, N.J., native has made a significant dent in repaying her debt, but still has about $50,000 to go.

About 42 million borrowers have about $1.3 trillion in student debt, up from roughly $826.5 billion in 2010, which includes federal loans and private loans from the six biggest lenders, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. The average debt for a college graduate in 2015 was about $35,000.

Even though Iampaglia's parents outright paid for her first two years at Ocean County College, she needed loans to finance her four years at the private Georgian Court University -- two for her bachelor's degree and two for her master's.

"I do well," said Iampaglia, who graduated in 2009 with her master's in business administration. "But I think most people without student loan debt -- if they made what I made -- would have two cars, a house, a dog and a child. I have an old car and I live with my mom."

A variety of factors impact the cost of college and a student's ability to pay back debt, said Mark Kantrowitz, a national student loan debt expert who has published several books, papers and editorials on the topic. The amount of debt an average college student has is affordable -- but then there are the outliers, he said.

Nationally, about a quarter of students graduate with excessive debt, but those who hurt the most are low-income students and students who take out loans but don't graduate. As a general rule, if a student's annual income is more than their student debt total, they shouldn't have trouble paying the loans back in 10 years or less, he said.

Those who do take on  heavy debt struggle, even with a "good" job, he said.

Christyn Gionfriddo, a Neptune, N.J., native and 2009 Centenary College graduate, is saddled with about $92,000 in student loan debt. At 29 years old, she still lives in her childhood bedroom, walls plastered with the same Dirty Dancing, 98 Degrees and Justin Timberlake posters from her tween years.

"Who wants to live at home at 29?" she said. "I don't. But luckily, I can. I have to be careful. I have to watch everything I spend. I shouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck."

The communications major didn't find a job in her field, but she is working in office administration with the opportunity for upward mobility. She also works on Saturdays when she can to help pay for her car and cellphone bills.

Gionfriddo said she got an academic scholarship for part of her first year, but her parents made too much money for her to qualify for any state or school grants.

The rising cost of tuition and fees is partly because of a decrease in state funding for higher education, experts say. There's less money going to the colleges to offset tuition hikes and provide financial aid for low-income students. But state funding isn't the only factor.

Colleges and universities have a different set of costs to consider when it comes to charging tuition -- health care, facility costs, energy costs -- which makes the price go up faster than consumer inflation, Kantrowitz said.

"It's a pretty expensive business model," said Will Doyle, a professor of higher education at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. "The biggest thing is personnel costs. Every year, (colleges) are part of an economy where it's really difficult to become more efficient. It's labor-intensive and it's assumed that it takes a certain number of people and a certain amount of time to run a college."

Public colleges make up that shortfall by increasing tuition, shifting enrollment by admitting more out-of-state and international students, switching from full-time faculty to adjuncts because they're cheaper, increasing class sizes and offering certain classes less often. Those changes can also affect the quality of education, he said.

"During an economic downturn, states have to balance budgets," Kantrowitz said. "Sales tax and income tax revenue are down -- and higher education is not a priority."

The national average cost for tuition and fees is $9,142. A study by Vanderbilt University and the Pennsylvania State University Graduate School of Education found that New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire's public, four-year tuition costs are the highest when compared as a percent of the state's average family income: 36%.

The lowest was Rhode Island at 19%. California, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Florida followed closely behind at 20%.

The trend over the past few decades has been to shift the cost from the government to families, Kantrowitz said. But that's a problem when family incomes have been flat for over 10 years.

The median family income rose by 0.8% from 1995 to 2005, but declined by 0.2% (adjusted for inflation) from 2005 to 2014, according to U.S. Census data.

Data show that the average income for college graduates is significantly higher than non-grads. Doyle said each year of education yields a 10% bump in income.

Both Democratic presidential candidates have included proposals for some kind of subsidized tuition for public colleges and lower student loan interest rates. But is it feasible?

Bernie Sanders' $75billion a year plan includes: eliminating tuition at public schools, cutting student loan interest rates to 2.37%, requiring higher-income students to pay for fees, room and board. The plan would be funded by taxing all Wall Street transactions a fraction of a percent.

Hillary Clinton's $350 billion, 10-year plan includes: free tuition by funneling money to states based on enrollment, requiring families to make a "realistic" contribution, requiring students to contribute wages from a 10-hour-per-week job, cutting interest loan rates in half, allowing graduates to refinance their debt at the lowest rates. The plan would be funded by "closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate."

Likely Republican nominee Donald Trump has offered few ideas for easing student debt aside from stating that the federal government shouldn't profit from such loans.

But Doyle said it's unclear to him how either of the Democrats' proposals would  work in practice. Setting aside politics and taxes, states have widely different subsidy patterns, and there would be "immediate"  concerns about how it would work from state to state.
