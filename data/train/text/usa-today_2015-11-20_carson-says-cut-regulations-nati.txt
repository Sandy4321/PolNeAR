Carson says cut regulations, national debt to reduce poverty.

Presidential candidate Ben Carson suggests reducing government regulations as a step toward reducing poverty in places like Cincinnati.

"It might surprise you, but one of the things would be to get rid of the excessive regulation in our country. It drives the prices of everything up," the Republican said this week.

He blamed the national debt for keeping interest rates low and making it impossible for poor people to grow their wealth.

"Poor people and middle-class people used to be able to grow their money by putting it in a savings account," Carson said in an alleyway behind The Cincinnatian hotel downtown. "You can't do that any more. Long-term bonds, nothing -- it's really these policies that are creating the real problem for the poor."

The New York Times quoted one of Carson's advisers as saying the retired neurosurgeon is having trouble understanding foreign policy despite intense briefings on the subject.

He brushed off these concerns. "I've been to 57 different countries, I've lived abroad, and I have common sense and a brain," he said, arguing that Hillary Clinton's experience as secretary of State didn't help her avoid problems.

He also laid out his plan for fighting the Islamic State, stating that the United States should formally declare war on the organization that has declared a "caliphate" in portions of Syria and Iraq. Carson also suggested rallying NATO and Middle Eastern allies and if necessary destroying oil fields to cut off the group's revenue.
