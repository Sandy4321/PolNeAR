Donald Trump Just Gave Some Free Stock Market Advice You’d Be Foolish To Ignore.

Republican and billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump gave those attending a Jan. 7 campaign rally in Burlington, Vt., some free investing advice.

“Be very conservative, because it could be very rough out there,” Trump said, adding a plug for himself as president. “And who can fix things better than me?”

Trump talked about the stock market and made comments about U.S. foreign policy. He said stocks aren’t a great investment right now.

“By the way, speaking of stock: You see the bubble, a little bubble. It’s starting to go a little bad. Some bad numbers coming out. Some really bad things. And you better be careful. Be careful,” Trump said.

While the U.S. added around 292,000 jobs in December, China suffered market chaos, and Wall Street had a bad day Thursday when stocks dropped more than 2 percent. Officials said 2016 has seen the worst four-day start in a new year on record.

Trump is touting a cautious stance in other interviews, stating in an interview on Fox News’ On the Record with Greta Van Susteren that the Chinese economy was in a precarious situation.

“They’re sitting on a little bit of a bubble – it could be a lot of bubble,” he said. “But we’re sitting on a bubble also.”

The businessman said China is expecting a 6.5 percent growth rate, while the U.S. will likely see a 2 percent growth rate. Trump said he’s not happy with those numbers.

“I’m not satisfied, but a lot of other people are satisfied. And we shouldn’t be satisfied with that number. We should be doing much better,” Trump said.

He said the U.S. agreement with Iran over nuclear weapons isn’t good for the United States, but will make Iran rich. He told voters that if Iran were a stock, he would advise buying it.
