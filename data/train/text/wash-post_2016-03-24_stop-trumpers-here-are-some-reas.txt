Stop-Trumpers, here are some reasons to have hope (and some reasons not to.)

Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz both campaigned hard in Arizona, hoping to score upsets over their parties' front-runners in the most populous of the three states that voted Tuesday.

They got crushed. Hillary Clinton beat the senator from Vermont by 18 points (58 percent to 40 percent) in the Grand Canyon State, and Donald Trump beat the senator from Texas by 22 points (47 to 25).

But in a reflection of how polarized both parties remain at this late stage in the primary calendar, Sanders won caucuses in Utah and Idaho with close to 80 percent of the vote. And Trump finished third behind John Kasich in Utah, getting just 14 percent. Cruz, who had the backing of Mitt Romney and capitalized on Mormon loathing for The Donald, pulled almost 70 percent. That gets him all 40 of the state's delegates.

The returns are the continuation of a pattern for both sides.

Sanders is favored to win a few upcoming contests in smaller, whiter states, but Clinton continues to maintain a hard-to-overtake delegate lead. Despite spending four days in Arizona over the past week and spending heavily on television advertising - touting the endorsement of Rep. RaÃÂol Grijalva (D-Ariz.) - Sanders could not make meaningful inroads with Hispanic voters. (Unfortunately, there are no exit polls.) That shows how nearly impossible it will be for him to win mega-states still on the calendar, such as New York or California.

Trump continues to dominate the GOP field despite tough press coverage and stepped-up attack ads. Most Republicans say they are embarrassed about how the race is playing out, but he is as strong a favorite as ever to be the nominee.

Here are three reasons the Stop Trump movement should be optimistic:

1.  Anti-Trump groups did not really invest in Arizona. But they did in Utah.

2.  Even in a state where his anti-illegal-immigration message is potent, Trump could not break 50 percent. Because of early voting, candidates who are no longer in the race received 18.2 percent (95,509 votes) in Arizona. And Kasich got 10 percent.

3.  Anti-Trump Republicans are coalescing behind Cruz.

Jeb Bush endorsed Cruz Wednesday. "Securing the Bush endorsement is a coup for Cruz, who may not be well liked by many GOP colleagues in Washington but can now boast the support of a key political family and its vast, unrivaled donor network," The Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe explained.

Aides say the former Florida governor plans to "actively support" Cruz. From Bush's Facebook post: "For the sake of our party and country, we must move to overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena, or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee."

Another, more self-interested, reason for Bush to back Cruz: his son. George P. Bush, the 39-year old Texas land commissioner, is now considered the Bush family's next best hope to reclaim the White House, but he cannot expect to easily advance in Texas politics without Cruz's support, O'Keefe notes.

The Club for Growth PAC has also endorsed Cruz - the first time it has weighed in during a presidential nominating contest.

Here are four reasons the Stop Trump movement should be pessimistic:

1.  Despite Cruz consolidating anti-Trump support, Trump continues to build up his delegate lead. Arizona was winner-take-all, meaning Trump gets 58 of the 98 delegates that were available Tuesday. By the Associated Press's tally, he now has 739 to Cruz's 465 and Kasich's 143.

2.  Kasich did not play the role of spoiler that he could have Tuesday, but he might in some upcoming primaries. He's campaigning Wednesday in Wisconsin and could split the vote. That said, Cruz cannot realistically get enough delegates to win the nomination outright at this point. He would probably need to win it on the convention floor. But a fresh CNN-ORC poll shows how hard it will be to deny Trump the nomination in Cleveland if he gets close to 1,237 but does not clinch: Six in 10 Republican said that if no candidate wins a majority of the delegates in the first ballot at the convention, the delegates "should vote for the candidate with the most support in the primaries and caucuses."

3.  After a quiet stretch, many of the upcoming contests favor Trump demographically. Trump is the favorite in Wisconsin's primary April 5. Then the campaign moves back to the Northeast, where voters are less religious and more blue-collar.

4.  Trump's numbers are not as toxic as most D.C. insiders believe. Wednesday's Quinnipiac poll has Clinton leading Trump by just six points (46 percent to 40 percent) and Cruz by three points (45 to 42) in head-to-head matchups. The Q poll also finds that, while 37 percent of Americans say Trump is "very responsible" for violence at his rallies, 39 percent blame his supporters and 22 percent say he is "not at all responsible."
