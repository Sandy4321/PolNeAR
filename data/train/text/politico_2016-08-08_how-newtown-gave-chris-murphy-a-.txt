How Newtown gave Chris Murphy a mission.

Few politicians would ever admit this, but Sen. Chris Murphy (a Connecticut Democrat so boyish he has been mistaken for a junior staffer) says he was unfocused, a bit adrift, in the weeks after being elected to the upper chamber in 2012.

Then came Dec. 14, 2012, and Murphy’s senatorial finding-himself period ended in an awful instant, before he was even sworn in. He was on a train platform in Bridgeport, en route to see the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree with his wife and two young kids, when he got the news that 20 schoolchildren had been murdered in Newtown, a 15-minute drive north.

Murphy sent his family home, showed up at the firehouse near Sandy Hook Elementary School where the families of the slain were gathering, and discovered the cause — gun control — he believes will forever define his career. The 43-year-old former congressman, who led a filibuster in June after the Orlando massacre, thinks the gun issue should now be a “litmus test” for being a Democrat.

“There wasn't one issue that was driving me to get up every day and go to work. There is today,” Murphy admitted during an interview for POLITICO’s “Off Message” podcast, as the Democratic National Convention was wrapping up.

This was a something I’d never heard before — a thought that a real person, someone with civilian self-awareness, not a senator, would say. A few minutes later, Murphy followed up by lamenting the churn of meaningless tasks his job entails, especially fundraising: “There’s just a ton of bullshit with this job,” he said.

In that sense, Sandy Hook wasn’t just a national tragedy, but a personal summons. “This was something different, right, in part because my son just graduated from first grade,” he added. “I'm the same age as all of these parents. I walked out of that tragedy feeling like I had just been handed my mission in public service, that if I wasn't able, in my career in the Senate, to do something meaningful to pay homage to those kids and those teachers, then I had failed.”

Murphy was elected to the House, after a decade in Connecticut politics, in 2006 — defeating moderate Republican Nancy Johnson in a Democratic wave year that saw the party take over the House. Core to his party’s comeback strategy that year: a decision by Senate campaign chairman Chuck Schumer and his House counterpart Rahm Emanuel to mute the core liberal anti-gun positions in hopes of propelling pro-gun candidates like Montana Sen. Jon Tester to victory.

It worked, but Murphy (who was always in favor of strict gun controls, but never focused on the issue) it exacted a great moral cost the party is only now reckoning with.

“I hold myself accountable. ... If you were a Democrat getting ready to run for office in the 2000s, as I was, you were told to stay clear of guns. ... I really regret that. I regret having listened to that advice, ” he said, echoing comments by his colleague, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in an emotional interview with me earlier this year.

“I mean, I didn't work on this issue until Sandy Hook. It wasn’t on my radar screen. And we’ve been living with the consequences of an anti-gun violence movement essentially laying dormant from 1994, when this mythology was created, that the assault weapons vote was what was responsible for the big losses that year,” Murphy said. “So, essentially, for 20 years the anti-gun violence movement did not exist.”

He added: “During that time the NRA built up this enormous political machine that beat us in 2013, on the background checks.”

That environment led to the biggest disappointment of his political life, and a defeat President Barack Obama believes to be the worst of his career: The failure to leverage national grief over the Connecticut killings into any new legislation, even minimalist bills restricting the number of bullets in ammo clips or increasing background checks.

Murphy’s 15-hour filibuster, which put him on the national political map (earning him a couple of cursory mentions on Hillary Clinton’s vice-presidential long list) was viewed as a victory by some in the movement; in reality, it yielded a couple of floor votes easily parried by the GOP majority.

Murphy’s floor speech wasn’t a solo effort — he was joined by most of the Democratic caucus — but he offered the emotional high (or low) point of the night, delivering a passionate tribute to 6-year-old Dylan Hockley and a teacher’s aide, Anne Marie Murphy, who was gunned down trying to protect him.

“It doesn’t take courage to stand here on the floor of the United States Senate for two hours or six hours or 14 hours,” Murphy said. “It takes courage to look into the eye of a shooter and instead of running, wrapping your arms around a 6-year-old boy and accepting death. ... If Anne Marie Murphy could do that, then ask yourself: What can you do to make sure that Orlando or Sandy Hook never, ever happens again?”

Murphy has an ally in Hillary Clinton. He thinks she would have been committed to the issue anyway, but believes the overwhelmingly popularity of gun control among Democrats, especially black voters, ensures her support. “Certainly, this was a way to create differentiation with Bernie Sanders in the primary,” he conceded.

“A lot of people predicted that this issue was going to disappear for her once the primary was done, and it hasn't because she is personally connected to it, and because it now has general election relevance in a way that it might not have just six months ago,” added Murphy, referring to the recent spate of killings — and Obama’s recent campaign to tie easy access of automatic weapons to incidents of homegrown terrorism.

If reducing gun violence is Murphy’s life’s work, his more immediate goal is to sell his own party on gun control as a central, perhaps the central issue. “This has become a litmus test issue for leadership in the Democratic Party,” he told me. “I think this presidential election has proven that you have to be right on the issue of guns.”

In terms of concrete deliverables, the election-year gun push (buoyed by near-universal voter support for expanded background checks), has yielded really only one actual victory: forcing Sanders to reverse his opposition to liability suits against gun manufacturers. “The primary has moved him on the issue of guns,” he said.

Murphy projects optimism, and he’s got a self-effacing streak uncommon in the puffy Senate (Part of that is wallet-related: Murphy may represent the wealthiest state in the union, but he’s one of the poorest members of the upper chamber millionaire’s club, with a net worth estimated at less than $100,000, according to Senate filings). When I ask him what he does in his spare time, he says not much really, not with the demands of being a father — then he mentions his role as the one of the youngest players on the congressional baseball team.

“I'm the catcher because there’s no other Democrat in Congress that can squat down and get back up again,” he said.

Murphy — after a knock-on-wood-gesture — told me he’s had a relatively tragedy-free life and was utterly unprepared for the emotional toll of his encounters with the Sandy Hook families those first few days after Adam Lanza, wearing earplugs and carrying a Bushmaster semiautomatic, entered Sandy Hook.

The story that most haunts Murphy, is that of middle-aged Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son Jesse was killed near his first-grade class. Heslin’s life (before and after his boy was murdered) isn’t the sort of tidy, sympathy-inducing tale that makes for tearful cable segments. As he became politically active after the shootings, gun rights activists dredged up Heslin’s brushes with the law stemming, in part, from substance abuse.

“He’s divorced from his wife and he, frankly, didn’t have a lot going on other than Jesse, who was his only son — and really the reason he got up every morning,” Murphy told me. “He dropped Jesse off at school that morning and Jesse told him, on the way in, as he left the car, ‘Dad, everything is going to be OK.’”

The senator paused and recalled the figure of Neil Heslin, sitting alone in the firehouse near the school after the shooting. The man didn’t accept anyone’s comfort, but he didn’t leave after almost everybody else headed home. It dawned on Murphy that Heslin simply had no reason to go home anymore, ever.

“There's something about all those stories, right?” said Murphy, who thinks often about the son’s reassuring final words to the father.

“I mean, I don't think that all those things are coincidences. ... I struggle with religion, but I get more of it, not less of it, coming off of that.”
