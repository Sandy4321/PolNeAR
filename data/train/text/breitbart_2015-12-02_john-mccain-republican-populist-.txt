John McCain: Republican Populist Anger Appeals to ‘Bad Angels Of Our Nature.’

Senator John McCain says the Republican populist movement that’s sweeping the country and boosting candidates including Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race appeals to the “bad angels” of human nature.

“It’s a reflection of frustration and anger that people feel,” McCain said, citing low economic growth, unemployment and growing economic inequality.

“A lot of it is justified because they have not seen a betterment of their lives that they had hoped to expect,” he continued, citing the many Americans who had given up looking for work entirely.

McCain made his remarks during the Christian Monitor Breakfast this morning in Washington D.C. He recalled that the roots of the populist revolt began during the Tea Party uprising in the Republican party in 2010 leading to gridlock and inaction.

“I think also and I probably shouldn’t say this but some of this appeals to the bad angels of our nature rather than the better angels of our nature,” he concluded.
