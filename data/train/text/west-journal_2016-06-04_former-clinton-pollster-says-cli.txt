Former Clinton Pollster Says Clinton Is In Trouble In California Primaries.

Former Bill Clinton pollster Douglas Schoen was a guest on Fox News Channel’s Hannity. Schoen described the dire situation Hillary Clinton is facing in Tuesday’s California primary against her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Sanders is only trailing by two points in the polls against Clinton, and within the margin of error, Sanders has a real chance of upsetting the party favorite (as evidenced by superdelegtes) in Clinton.

Schoen told host Sean Hannity a Clinton loss is “increasingly likely.”

The former pollster said, “She’s behind Donald Trump in a number of polls, we’ve got the Justice Department likely to render a judgment that finds some culpability somewhere, don’t you think, Sean, that the Democratic Party will say ‘Why do we need this? Why do we need to risk a defeat with Secretary Clinton?’”

Schoen contends the Democratic Party’s superdelegates may switch sides and nominate Sanders to run against Trump.

Schoen elaborated in an editorial piece for The Wall Street Journal that superdelegates currently pledged to Clinton, even those who did so before the campaign began, may reconsider.

“A Sanders win in California would powerfully underscore Mrs. Clinton’s weakness as a candidate in the general election…Democratic superdelegates– chosen by the party establishment and overwhelmingly backing Mrs. Clinton, 543-44 — would seriously question whether they should continue to stand behind her candidacy.”

The pollster even hypothesized Clinton could easily be replaced by Vice President Joe Biden. “[W]ith her poll numbers dropping, her legal headaches increasing, the Sanders candidacy showing renewed vigor, and Donald Trump looming as a wrecking ball for the president’s legacy, Mr. Obama and adviser Valerie Jarrett might begin sending signals to the Democratic National Committee and to the vice president that a Biden rescue operation wouldn’t displease the White House,” Schoen said.
