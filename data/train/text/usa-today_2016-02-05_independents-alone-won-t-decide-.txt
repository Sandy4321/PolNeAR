Independents alone won't decide N.H.; 
Candidates will need solid backing by party core, analysts say.

New Hampshire's independent voters won't by themselves determine winners and losers in the state's first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday.

But those voters, who officially register as "undeclared," can determine degrees of separation between winners and losers, which could be particularly relevant this year for Bernie Sanders.

The Vermont senator, running against former secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, leads Clinton 50% to 40% among registered Democrats in New Hampshire, according to a CNN/WMUR poll. His lead among undeclared voters who say they'll vote in the Democratic primary is much larger -- 64% to 27%, according to the poll.

"I have never voted in a primary, but I'm going to vote in this primary for Bernie," said Nicky Driscoll, 24,  from Manchester, who said Sanders is best suited to get corporate money out of government. "It's supposed to be for the people, not the Walmart."

Undeclared voters can vote in either party's primary. They represent the state's largest bloc of voters, but they turn out at lower rates during primaries than registered partisans, according to Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted the CNN/WMUR poll. They tend to be younger and newer to the state, and they haven't had much time to become engaged in politics. They also can't be counted on to propel a candidate to victory. In this year's Republican contest, undeclared voters aren't likely to help one candidate more than another, Smith said.

"Nobody's ever won their party's primary here in New Hampshire without winning a plurality of their party's registered voters," Smith said. "You've got to win your own party's voters. You can't rely on independent voters to win anything here."
