Clinton blasts Trump over 'deportation force' idea.

Hillary Clinton has a word for Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 million people from the country: No.

The Democratic presidential candidate blasted Trump's call for a "deportation force" on Wednesday, calling it "absurd."

"The idea of tracking down and deporting 11 million people is absurd, inhumane, and un-American. No, Trump. -H" Clinton tweeted, quoting a New York Times reporter's tweet on Trump's comments made earlier in the morning on MSNBC.

In an extended appearance on "Morning Joe," co-host Mika Brzezinski asked Trump how he would handle the deportation of everyone in the United States illegally, if he would have a "deportation force."

"You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely and you’re going to bring the country -- and, frankly, the people, because you have some excellent, wonderful people, some fantastic people that have been here for a long period of time," Trump said. "Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they’re waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. It's going to be a real deal. It’s going to be a real wall."
