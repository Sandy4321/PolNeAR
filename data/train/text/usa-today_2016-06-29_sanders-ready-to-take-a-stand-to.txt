Sanders ready to take a stand to push for 'progressive' platform.

Sen. Bernie Sanders says he is prepared for a floor fight at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia if the party doesn't take more "progressive" stances on trade, the minimum wage, climate change and other issues in its platform.

The Vermont senator told USA TODAY that  there are "a lot of very good and progressive" provisions in the document approved Saturday in St. Louis by the 15-member Platform Drafting Committee, which includes supporters of Sanders and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

But Sanders and his supporters will work with labor, environmental and human rights groups to call for amendments when the draft goes to the full 187-member Platform Committee for final approval in Orlando July 8 and 9. If he doesn't succeed there, Sanders said he will have the votes to bring amendments to the convention floor.

He acknowledged it would be easier if his changes were adopted in Orlando. A floor fight at the convention could prolong it.

"The middle class of this country has been in decline for 40 years and we need to make it clear that we stand with working families in this country and we are prepared to take on powerful special interests," he said. "That is what the Democratic Party has got to stand for."

Sanders has said he will vote for Clinton, but he hasn't endorsed her or conceded his bid for the Democratic nomination.
