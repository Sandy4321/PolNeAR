Cruz: Trump Would Put Liberals On Court, ‘I Fear The Same Thing Is True’ for Rubio.

Republican presidential candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz argued that if fellow candidate Donald Trump is president “we will see liberals on the court, and we will see our rights taken away” and that he fears the same is true if fellow candidate Florida Senator Marco Rubio is elected on Wednesday’s “Sean Hannity Show.”

Cruz said, “If we give up the Supreme Court for a generation, and strip away the constitutional rights of our kids, at that point, the Republican Party no longer stands for anything.”

Cruz added that he was the only to spend their entire life “fighting to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I’ll tell you this, if Donald Trump becomes president, we will see liberals on the court, and we will see our rights taken away. The 2nd Amendment will be effectively erased from the Bill of Rights. And sadly, I fear the same thing is true if Marco Rubio were to become president. Why do I say that? If you look at Republicans in the past, many of the worst judicial activists were put on by Republicans who didn’t want to take the political heat and fight to confirm a conservative.”
