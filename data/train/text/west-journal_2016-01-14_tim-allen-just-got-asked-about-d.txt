Tim Allen Just Got Asked About Donald Trump – His Response Might Infuriate Most Of Hollywood.

Already a television icon for his portrayal of Tim Taylor in the hit series Home Improvement, veteran comedian Tim Allen recently hit another milestone with the 100th episode of his current ABC series, Last Man Standing.

As star and executive producer of the show, Allen has been able to insert more than a few partisan lines into the script – generally to be uttered by family patriarch Mike Baxter, portrayed by Allen.

Discussing the show’s success and political tones in a Fox411 interview, the actor explained the similarities and differences between him and his highly opinionated on-screen character.

“I’m not as well worded,” he said, “because Mike Baxter can say this stuff quickly and funny.”

Noting he majored in philosophy during college, Allen said he tends to give issues more deliberation.

“I’m always searching upriver for how things started,” he said. “I can be more excessive on either side. I can be really either left-leaning or very, very right-leaning – but I end up center-right.”

When the interview steered Allen toward his outlook on the 2016 presidential field, he offered his thoughts on Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s continued appeal among a loyal group of supporters.

“I think it’s funny,” he said, “because Donald Trump is kind of in the spirit of old Greek tyrants, where they used to vote in a guy that had no encumbrances.”

Acknowledging that Trump “says a lot of stupid stuff,” though, Allen did suggest that the real estate mogul’s wealth does give him a unique advantage.

“So the smartest thing about him, which is probably most overlooked, to me, is that he doesn’t owe anybody anything,” Allen concluded. “And if he would just stick to fixing the bridges, roads and infrastructures – that’s what he knows how to do – just keep him doing that.”
