DNC issues ‘deep and sincere apology’ to Bernie Sanders.

PHILADELPHIA, July 25 (UPI) — The Democratic National Committee released a statement at the outset of the party’s convention Monday, offering “a deep and sincere apology” to Sen. Bernie Sanders after leaked emails showed DNC staff favoring Hillary Clinton.

DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she will resign her post after the convention, to be replaced by veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile through the November election.

At Brazille’s direction, the DNC issued a statement apologizing to Sanders for the emails, which included staff members suggesting someone should question Sanders’ Jewish faith.

“On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Senator Sanders, his supporters and everyone in the Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email. These comments to not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not — and will not — tolerate disrespectful language toward our candidates. Individual staffers have rightly apologized for their comments and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.”

The statement was signed by Brazile, not Wasserman Schultz.

The reconciliation attempt comes after Sanders delegates inside the convention hall in Philadelphia have loudly booed the mention of Hillary Clinton or her newly-announced running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.

Sanders sent a mass text message to his supporters in Philadelphia, asking them not to stage protests inside the hall — a message that, at least at the outset, has not been heeded.

“I ask you as a personal courtesy to me not to engage in any kind of protest on the floor,” Sanders said, according to CNN. “It’s of utmost importance you explain this to your delegations.”

Sanders is scheduled to address the convention Monday night.
