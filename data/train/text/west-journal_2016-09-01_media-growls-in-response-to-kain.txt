Media Growls In Response To Kaine’s Claim Clinton ‘Talks To the Press Everywhere She Goes.’

Whether they know it or not, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is very accessible to the media, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine insisted Thursday during a whistle stop tour of morning news shows.

Kaine dug himself a hole when, during his appearance on CBS This Morning, he went beyond the bounds of what his interviewers thought was plausible.

“You see Hillary take questions from reporters every day. She does. She talks to the press everywhere she goes,” Kaine responded.

Co-anchor Norah O’Donnell, who was off-screen, then loundly asked, “Really?”

Debate on the remark was not confined to the show.

Jason Miller, senior communications adviser for Donald Trump’s campaign, jumped on Kaine’s remark.

As of Thursday, Clinton has gone 271 days without a press conference. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump conducts them repeatedly.

Kaine decried that math, saying Clinton took questions during an appearance at the joint convention of the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists last month. Kaine dubbed her appeared a “press conference.”

“But that was the first time in a long time, senator,” CBS This Morning co-Anchor DeMarco Morgan said. “She doesn’t do it that often.”

Kaine did not see the media’s point.

“I don’t see what the massive difference is between a press conference and talking to the press everywhere you go,” he said. “She talks to the press a lot. And I’ve been with her when she has talked to the press.”

But as Liz Kreutz points out in a column on Yahoo News, doing one-on-one interviews gives Clinton a huge advantage over a press conference setting.

“The practice of choosing one-on-one interviews instead of news conferences, however, allows the campaign more control over the message,” Kreutz wrote. “They get to choose who interviews Clinton and when.”
