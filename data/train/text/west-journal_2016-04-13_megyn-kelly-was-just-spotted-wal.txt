Megyn Kelly Was Just Spotted Walking Into The Last Place Anyone Would Expect Her To.

MSNBC’s Ayman Mohyeldin reported Wednesday that Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly was seen entering Trump Tower in New York City. According to some on Twitter, Kelly was “incognito,” sparking a firestorm of speculation as to the reason for the visit.

Fox News confirmed that Kelly met with Trump.

According to the statement, Kelly met with Trump to discuss plans for a Fox Broadcasting special, similar to those performed by Barbara Walters.

“Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has spoken to Donald Trump a few times over the past three months about appearing on a Fox Broadcasting special with Megyn Kelly airing on May 23. Kelly requested a meeting with Mr. Trump, which took place at Trump Tower this morning,” the statement read.

“The results of that meeting will be revealed on tonight’s Kelly File at 9 p.m. Eastern. Kelly has acknowledged in recent interviews that Trump is a fascinating person to cover and has electrified the Republican base.”

While it is certainly no surprise that Kelly would seek some form of interview with a high-profile candidate like Trump, their relationship to date has been anything but cordial.

Kelly initially came under fire from Trump over what he perceived to be unfair questions during the first presidential debate. Since that time, Trump has routinely gone after Kelly for what he also perceives as unfair reporting on her show The Kelly File.

Based on the statement released by Fox News, it seems some convincing was needed on behalf of Ailes who “has spoken to Donald Trump a few times over the past three months about appearing” on the special.
