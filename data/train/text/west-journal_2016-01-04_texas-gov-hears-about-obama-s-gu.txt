Texas Gov. Hears About Obama’s Gun Grab, Launches EPIC 4-Word Warning To White House.

During his 2008 campaign for president, Barack Obama made clear his aim to “fundamentally transform” the United States. One area that Obama has failed thus far to “fundamentally transform” is Americans Second Amendment rights. Now, as the end of his presidency is in sight, Obama is looking to put restrictions on the Second Amendment via Executive Order.

As President Obama announces that he is ready for the fight against legal guns, he is set to release a series of Executive Orders meant to put a dent in the gun industry and in the ability of Americans to purchase firearms.

As the White House hints at what some of his plans might include, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is not having any of it, immediately delivering a stark message on his Twitter account in defiance of the President’s plans.

With a tweet featuring an image based on the famed Gonzales flag, Abbott told the President that if he wants our guns, “come and take it.”

Abbott isn’t alone with his criticism. According to the Washington Post, the President has not bothered to ask for input from Republicans or pro-Second Amendment Democrats.

“The administration has not communicated with us, and we have not been briefed,” Doug ­Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan told the Post. “We will consider options once we have information, but what seems apparent is none of these ideas would have prevented the recent atrocities. Our focus should be on the consistent causes of these acts–mental illnesses and terrorism–rather than infringing on law-abiding Americans’ constitutional rights.”

Finally, preparing itself for Obama’s attack on the Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association has put out a new video ad ripping Hillary Clinton for her anti-gun agenda.
