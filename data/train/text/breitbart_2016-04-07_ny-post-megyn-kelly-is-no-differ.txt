NY Post: Megyn Kelly Is No Different Than Kim Kardashian.

From Andrea Peyser writing at The New York Post:

"Rising to the A-list from the middle of the pack requires extreme cunning, good hair and laser-focused determination.

"Or, if you’re Megyn Kelly, all you need to fixate the world’s attention on your brains or your boobs and butt — the kind of fame-whoredom practiced by dames from Hillary Clinton to Kim Kardashian — is to metaphorically crush the naughty bits of Donald Trump.

“You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,” Kelly charged in her now-infamous assault.
