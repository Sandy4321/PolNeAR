Clinton camp: Trump’s Islamaphobia threatens national security.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (UPI) — In response to Donald Trump’s proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States, Hillary Clinton’s right-hand woman rallied supporters, saying: “We have to be ready to stop him.”

Huma Abedin, vice chairwoman for Clinton’s presidential campaign, emailed supporters on Monday evening, telling them, “I am a proud Muslim — but you don’t have to share my faith to share my disgust.”

The email goes on to say: “Trump wants to literally write racism into our law books … his Islamaphobia doesn’t reflect our nation’s values — it goes far enough to damage our country’s reputation and could even threaten our national security.”

The New York Times reported the email came hours after Donald Trump proposed a ban on Muslims trying to enter the U.S. The proposal has drawn harsh criticism from fellow GOP presidential hopefuls. On Twitter, Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called Trump “unhinged.” Sen. Marco Rubio called the statement “offensive and outlandish.”

Democratic candidates went further, with former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley calling Trump a fascist. Clinton slammed the proposal as “reprehensible, prejudiced and divisive.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also sent out a fundraising call following the remarks, asking supports to “donate $3 to our campaign now to condemn Donald Trump’s hate and racism.”

A producer for Yahoo Studios told The New York Times Tuesday morning that Trump abruptly canceled a scheduled interview with Katie Couric. Trump’s campaign has not commented on the reason for canceling the interview, which had been in the works since the summer.
