Look: Man Spotted Directly Behind Hillary At Rally Wearing Shirt She’ll HATE.

Western Journalism reported recently about a hapless college student referred to on social media as #stickerboy, who was able to get into a Hillary Clinton rally last month in Iowa. ‘Stickerboy’ placed two stickers over his face and danced around gleefully, earning temporary fame nonetheless.

As it turns out, at least two men attended another Clinton event, also not necessarily to support the candidate. But it’s not stickers on their faces earning them national attention; it’s the shirts they’re wearing–and specifically what’s written on them.

According to The Federalist, the men were wearing shirts that read “Settle for Hillary.”

They were also immediately noticed on social media. Jeff Bechdel, chairman of America Rising (a Republican PAC), tweeted: “People behind @HillaryClinton wearing “Settle For Hillary” shirts at her event in Hudson, NH… ouch. #nhpolitics.”

Another person tweeted: “EPIC Troll at Hillary town hall. Still from CNN Clip #SettleForHillary #feelthebern.”

The message coincides with what others are saying about the candidate choices Democrats have.

Ed Krayewski may have said it best when he blogged: “Hillary Clinton is as close to a pre-selected candidate as this cycle’ll see.” He mentioned a long list of candidates who could have run but didn’t, like  Bill Bradley, Al Gore, Joseph Biden, Harry Reid, Jim Webb, Andrew Cuomo, and Jerry Brown.

Even Democratic presidential candidates noticed early on there were few choices for the Democratic nominee. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said back in the summer of 2015: “I think it’s a big mistake for us as a party to circle the wagons around the inevitable front-runner.”

Complicating matters, an active investigation of Clinton is underway by the FBI for her handling of classified information. Depending on the outcome of the FBI investigation, settling for Hillary Clinton might not even be an option.
