Sanders campaign buys ad time for 4 Super Tuesday states.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign has reserved time for television advertisements in at least four Super Tuesday states, according to media buying sources.

The initial buys, which will likely rise, are in Minnesota (around $240,000), Colorado (around $700,000), Massachusetts (around $300,000) and Oklahoma (around $400,000).

By looking beyond the upcoming contests in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the Sanders' camp is investing for a long, drawn-out contest with Hillary Clinton.

Both campaigns are advertising currently in Nevada and South Carolina, the next two contests after Tuesday’s primary in New Hampshire, where Sanders is expected to win after Clinton's narrow win in Iowa last week.

Minnesota and Colorado in particular are seen as opportunities for Sanders, largely because they have heavily liberal, largely white Democratic constituents and are caucus states where he has built up organizations.

Massachusetts has been a target of his for months and some of his New Hampshire advertising in the Boston market has been built around raising awareness of Sanders for Massachusetts voters. While the Vermont senator is an even heavier underdog in Oklahoma, meanwhile, his team believes that the few Democrats there may be ripe targets for him.

Sanders aides declined to confirm the buys.
