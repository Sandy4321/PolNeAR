The Latest GOP Debate Kicked Off In The Most Awkward Way.

The beginning of Saturday night’s ABC News GOP debate could not have been more awkward.

Missed cues and a camera stare-down made for some painful moments. The moderators almost forgetting to introduce one candidate was more than painful.

Watch the video above.

Republicans this election cycle don't have a very good track record when it comes to speaking about religious and racial discrimination.
Donald Trump was asked a relatively straightforward question about police violence against people of color.
"There are many who argue that cell phones and smartphones are just now exposing what has been happening in this country for years -- cases of excessive force against minorities," the moderator said. "As you know, Mr. Trump, on the other side, the FBI director recently said there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of increased scrutiny. You have said police are the most mistreated people in America. As president, how do you bridge the divide?"
Trump acknowledged that a rift does exist between communities of color -- mainly African-Americans and Latinos -- and the police. But he stood by comments he had made previously about police being disrespected.
"I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood," he said. "And if there is an incident -- whether it's an incident done purposely, which is a horror, and you should take very strong action. Or if it is a mistake, it's on your newscasts all night, all week, all month and it never ends."
"The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order. And they're afraid for their jobs,” he continued. "They're afraid of the mistreatment they get and I'm telling you that not only me speaking [but] minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect."
Trump then reiterated the basic premise of the "Ferguson Effect." FBI Director James Comey coined this term when he attributed rising murder rates in some U.S. cities, like Baltimore and Chicago, to police officers acting cautiously because they were scared of the backlash that had followed an officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014.
If the so-called Ferguson Effect existed, there would be more dead cops and streets would be less safe. But, in 2015, it wasn’t any more dangerous to be a police officer than it has been in the past. 
When the moderator pointed out that Trump hadn't answered the question, the candidate said families of people killed by police file lawsuits. 
"They sue," he said. "Everybody sues, right?"
Later, Marco Rubio claimed that Muslim Americans don’t face discrimination and that President Barack Obama is to blame for Americans believing that.
"He continues to put out this fiction that there's widespread discrimination against Muslim Americans," he said. "First of all, let's recognize this: If you go to a national cemetery in this country, you will see Stars of David and crosses, but you see crescent moons. There are brave men and women who happen to be Muslim Americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country -- and we recognize that and we honor that."
The next stop on this long path of missing the point was, of course, talking about terrorism.
"But by the same token, we face a very significant threat of homegrown violent extremism," Rubio continued. "We need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they can identify and report this activity. Especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech but inciting violence."

Jeb Bush criticized Marco Rubio for opposing legal abortion in cases of rape and incest.
"I'm pro-life, but I believe there should be exceptions: rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger," Bush said. "And so that belief and my consistency on this makes me, I think, poised to be in the right place, in the sweet spot for a Republican nominee. ... We have to be cognizant of the fact that there's a lot of people concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions."
Rubio said he does support making an exception if the life of the mother is in danger, but not for cases of rape or incest.
"It's a difficult issue," said the Florida senator, "because it puts in conflict two competing rights. On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body, which is a real right, and on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live. As a policymaker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence, and I've chosen to err on the side of life."  
Rubio said the real extremist on abortion is Hillary Clinton, and he railed against Democratic debate moderators for failing to bring up abortion during any of the five debates so far.
"On abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child?" Rubio said.
The source of Rubio's attack is unclear. While Clinton is an outspoken supporter of Roe v. Wade, which legalizes abortion up until the fetus would be viable outside the womb -- around 22 weeks of pregnancy -- she has never said she would support legal abortion up until the due date.

Chris Christie said he would quarantine people over fears of the Zika virus, which is spread primarily by mosquitoes and may cause birth defects in children born to infected women.
"You bet I would," Christie said when asked whether he would issue a quarantine for people traveling into the U.S. from Brazil, where the number of reported cases of the virus has grown.
When a nurse who had been treating Ebola patients in West Africa returned to the U.S., the governor ordered such a quarantine, even though she did not carry the virus. The nurse later sued, claiming the quarantine violated her constitutional rights.
Ben Carson, the only doctor on stage, was more measured on the topic.
"If we have evidence they are infected and there is evidence that infection can spread by something they are doing, then yes," Carson said of a potential travel ban. But, Carson added, he did not support issuing quarantines "willy-nilly."
"I don't believe that's going to work," he said.

When asked about New Hampshire’s opioid crisis, Ted Cruz said he knows the tragic consequences of opioid addiction firsthand. He lost his older half-sister to an overdose several years ago. She had struggled her whole life, Cruz explained, recalling the time he and his father visited her at a crack house in an attempt to get her to leave her addiction behind to be a mother to her son.
"This is an absolute epidemic," Cruz said. "We need leadership to solve it. Solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like AA and counseling and churches and charities." It’s unclear if Cruz is aware that much funding for state treatment comes from federal grants, or of Alcoholics Anonymous' low success rate in treating those with opioid-use disorder.  
Cruz pivoted to arguing that the epidemic was one more reason to secure the border with Mexico, in order to prevent heroin traffickers from crossing into the U.S.
Chris Christie added that he would approve cross-border enforcement without cooperation from the Mexican government. He also said he was working with the New Hampshire government on legislation similar to diversion programs he implemented in New Jersey. In his state, Christie said, nonviolent first-time drug offenders are sent to mandatory drug treatment. The governor claimed that crime has gone down 20 percent and the prison population has gone down 10 percent.
"This is a disease," Christie said. "It’s not a moral failing. It’s a disease, and we need to give people the treatment they need. And let me tell you why -- because I’m pro-life."
Neither Cruz nor Christie acknowledged the Obama administration's efforts to combat the epidemic. Earlier this week, the president proposed nearly $1 billion in funds to help states provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid addicts.

Donald Trump didn't back away from his pledge to reintroduce waterboarding, a torture technique used by the CIA under President George W. Bush.
"We have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people," Trump said. "Not since medieval times have we seen what's going on. I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding."
Trump was out-brutalizing Ted Cruz, who said he would only use waterboarding sparingly, in emergency scenarios. Cruz denied that waterboarding constitutes torture, however, appearing to rely on Bush lawyer John Yoo's discredited definition of the term, in which torture only includes practices that result in organ failure or death.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticized President Barack Obama's 2011 intervention in Libya for leaving the country in much worse shape.
Bush said history has shown the need to have a "stable government" in place when beginning a military campaign like the one in Libya.
Left unmentioned, however, was his brother's military intervention in Iraq, one of the costliest in U.S. history.

MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The National Review is hosting a debate watch party at the Radisson in downtown Manchester, which is a central meeting place for reporters and political operatives in town for the primaries.
The conservative publication has been outspoken in its opposition to Donald Trump, arguing he is "philosophically unmoored political opportunist who would trash the broad conservative ideological consensus within the GOP in favor of a free-floating populism with strong-man overtones."

The attendees at the National Review's party are similarly skeptical. They have consistently booed Trump's answers, while often cheering for the more establishment candidates -- Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush.
There is also a cash bar, and the atmosphere in the room has gotten more lively as the debate has gone on.

The fangs came out early in Saturday night's GOP debate, where Chris Christie lit into Marco Rubio for giving the same damn speech over and over again, no matter what the question, because he's simply not qualified to be president.
Christie's been making the case for weeks that Rubio isn't ready for the White House. "You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable," he said. "You just simply haven't."
Rubio fired back at Christie over New Jersey's credit rating being downgraded nine times. But then he transitioned into an unrelated speech about President Barack Obama's agenda.
"Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing," said Rubio. "He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world; we want to be the United States of America."
The moderators were ready to move on, but Christie wasn't having it.
"You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. does," he said. "The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him."
The crowd went nuts.
"When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person," said Christie. "They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open."
Rubio hit back again, saying Christie was too focused on his campaign to care about the blizzard that hit his state last month. But then, he did it again. The same speech!
"Here's the bottom line," Rubio added. "This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he's doing."
"There it is. There it is," Christie said to laughs. "The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody."

Real estate mogul Donald Trump drew boos from the audience when he told Jeb Bush to quiet down during a heated exchange on the issue of eminent domain.
Trump defended eminent domain, calling the expropriation of private property for public use an "absolute necessity" for the government to build schools, roads and bridges. He also argued the Keystone XL pipeline, which is widely supported by Republicans, "wouldn't go 10 feet" without the use of eminent domain.
Bush, however, interjected by hitting Trump for using eminent domain to attempt to seize private property from an elderly woman to "turn into limousine parking lot for his casinos" in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
"Jeb wants to be a tough guy tonight," Trump shot back. "Let me talk."
"Quiet," he demanded, as Bush continued to interject. The audience booed loudly. 
Trump then accused the audience, which is primarily selected by the Republican National Committee, of consisting of "donors and special interests" -- essentially the establishment he rails against.
"They're booing because I don’t want their money," he said.

Marco Rubio defended himself on Saturday for bailing on his own comprehensive immigration reform bill, arguing that dropping the plan once it became clear it would not pass was an example of his leadership.
Rubio tried at first to skirt the question of whether he had really fought for the bill, which passed the Senate in 2013 but never got a vote in the House.
But Chris Christie, eager all evening to jab senators for failing to show leadership, attacked Rubio for not answering the question.
"It is abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation," Christie said, adding that he had fought for bills in his time as governor of New Jersey. "A leader must fight for what they believe in, not handicap and say well maybe since I can't win this one, I'll run. That's not what leadership is; that's what Congress is."
Rubio disagreed.
"Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem," he said. "And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over 10 years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage. It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening."
Rubio said that the only thing the American people would support is a border-first approach, then cracking down on unauthorized immigration, then addressing the undocumented population and determining who should be allowed to stay.

Donald Trump, who has made favorable comments about single-payer health care in the past, defended his commitment to achieving universal coverage and provided new details about his plans.
"We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better," Trump said, repeating a common line.
He then provided a broad outline for how he would deal with that: by increasing competition among private health insurers and encouraging health savings accounts.
And he managed to do it with his unique populist flair, slamming the profit-mongering of private insurance companies.
"The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare, on health care and health services," Trump said. "We are going to get a plan where people compete so much better."
But Trump went further, embracing his reputation as perhaps the most liberal Republican candidate when it comes to health care.
"There is certain number of people that are going to be on the street dying -- and as a Republican, I don’t want that to happen," Trump said.
He concluded by implying that some government-provided insurance would be necessary for providing those most vulnerable people with health care. It is unclear whether that means he would approve of expanding Medicaid -- government-provided insurance for people living in poverty -- as President Barack Obama did through the Affordable Care Act.

John Kasich said Saturday that allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S. was not out of step with Americans -- but it clearly was out of step with much of the debate stage.
The Ohio governor said the U.S. needs to secure the border and create a guest-worker program, but that he would not support mass deportation or driving out the entire 11 million-person undocumented population.
"I couldn't even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they've been here, leaving their children in the house," he said. "That is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in."
"At the end of the day, Americans would support a plan like this," he added.  
Kasich said he would present an immigration plan to Congress within his first 100 days as president and that he thinks it would pass.
Right afterward, Ted Cruz talked up his plans to force undocumented immigrants out.

Donald Trump returned to his favorite whipping horse to answer how he would deal with North Korea: China.
Trump said the onus was on the Chinese to deal with North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons -- and that as president he would have the power to get them to do it.
“The Chinese have complete control over North Korea,” Trump said.Trump claimed that he learned this from Chinese business people with whom he has worked.
Mostly for Trump, though, it was an opportunity to bash the United States' trade with China.
“They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country and they are using it to rebuild China,” Trump said, harping on his favorite theme.Trump’s plan to have the Chinese dispense with North Korea is consistent, however, with his preference for having regional actors address international conflicts whenever possible -- so the U.S. can avoid getting dragged into a quagmire.

He said CNN had tweeted that Carson was taking a break from the campaign and that Tapper, Bash and Blitzer had mentioned it on television -- all true. Only, CNN didn't report that Carson was dropping out. Carson noted that CNN's Chris Moody had tweeted that the candidate was staying in the race right after he tweeted that Carson was returning to Florida.

Ted Cruz apologized for his campaign’s decision to tell supporters on the eve of the Iowa caucus that Dr. Ben Carson had dropped out of the race.
Cruz claimed that his campaign had misinterpreted a CNN report that Carson would not be continuing on to New Hampshire and South Carolina after the Iowa caucus. CNN, Cruz said, called the announcement “highly significant."
Cruz said that he had since apologized to Carson, whom he considers a friend.
Prior to Cruz's apology, Carson had made a bizarre, thinly-veiled attack on the Cruz campaign’s decision to tell its supporters that Carson had dropped out of the race.
Carson noted that Saturday would have been former President Ronald Reagan’s 105th birthday and quoted Reagan’s “eleventh commandment” -- “Thou shall not speak ill of thy fellow Republican.”
But if Carson implied that he would not criticize Cruz, he did not exactly follow Reagan’s dictum in his next comment.
He said that the Cruz campaign’s announcement, which some have argued was intended to get Carson supporters to caucus for Cruz, was an “insult” to the “hundreds and maybe thousands” of young volunteers for the Carson campaign.
Carson noted that one of them had “even died” while volunteering for his campaign.
Carson campaign volunteer Braden Joplin indeed died in a car crash in Atlantic, Iowa, in January.

Real estate mogul Donald Trump got the better of Ted Cruz in their first exchange of the night.

Trump, however, wasted no time responding.
"If you noticed, he didn't answer your question," he said of Cruz. "That's what's going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We're going to win with Trump. People back down with Trump. That's what I like and that's what the country likes."
Moments earlier, in his opening remarks, Trump said he was ideally suited for the presidency.
"I actually think I have the best temperament," he said of the 2016 field.
