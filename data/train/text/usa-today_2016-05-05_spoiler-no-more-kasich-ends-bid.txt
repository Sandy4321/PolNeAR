Spoiler no more: Kasich ends bid.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich suspended his presidential campaign Wednesday evening, telling supporters in Columbus, Ohio, that he had "renewed faith" that "the Lord will show me the way forward."

Trump's victory in Indiana on Tuesday night all but sealed the GOP nomination, leading Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to drop out of the race. Kasich had long been mathematically eliminated from winning the GOP nomination. Critics said he was playing a spoiler by staying in. And taking on Trump one-on-one would have required millions more in cash than Kasich had. His campaign's and his political action committee's coffers had dwindled to $1.2 million each by the end of March.

Still, Kasich had planned to continue his bid as the lone and unlikely alternative to Trump -- even though the trailed Trump by nearly 900 delegates.

The pressure to drop out ramped up quickly. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted Tuesday night he considered Trump the "presumptive nominee."

Trump welcomed the news that Kasich would quit, saying the Ohio Republican was "doing the right thing," suggesting he might consider Kasich as vice presidential contender, CNN reported. Kasich has said he is not interested in the No. 2 spot on a Trump ticket.
