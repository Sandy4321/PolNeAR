Brooks: Rubio Did Well In ‘More Rubio-Style Debate,’ Than He Did Going ‘In the Gutter.’

New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that Thursday’s GOP debate was a “more Rubio-style” and the GOP candidate and Florida Senator “did well, because it was a substantive debate. It was more uplifting” and Rubio was hurt by going “personally, just in the gutter” against fellow candidate Donald Trump on Friday’s “PBS NewsHour.”

Brooks said the tone of the debate “was because the other candidates decided, especially Marco Rubio, that if they go after Trump the way they were, personally, just in the gutter, that they end up hurting themselves. And I think there’s some evidence for Rubio to that effect. And so it was a more Rubio-style debate. And I thought he did well, because it was a substantive debate. It was more uplifting. And he did well, but not substantially well enough to change the nature of the race, I don’t think.”
