Donald Trump Denies Mike Tyson Invited to Appear at GOP Convention.

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is discrediting an earlier report from Bloomberg saying Trump’s campaign invited Mike Tyson to appear at the GOP National Convention in July, where Trump will officially be named the Republican Party nominee.

“Donald Trump’s campaign aides are lining up a slate of iconic sports figures to appear at the convention in Cleveland next month—including former undisputed world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, legendary Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight, and NASCAR chief Brian France, people familiar with the planning told Bloomberg Politics,” Bloomberg reported on Tuesday evening.

The report of Tyson appearing at the convention sparked backlash from members of the press on Twitter and ultimately resulted in Trump’s tweet discrediting the report.
