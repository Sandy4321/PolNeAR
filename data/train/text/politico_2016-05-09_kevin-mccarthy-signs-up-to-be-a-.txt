Kevin McCarthy signs up to be a Trump delegate.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has signed up to serve as a delegate for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump at this summer’s national convention in Cleveland.

McCarthy’s move is notable in part because House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he is “not ready” to endorse Trump, even though he is the lone Republican remaining in the contest.

"I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now," Ryan said last week on CNN, though he said, "I hope to."

Trump is scheduled to meet with Ryan and other top congressional Republicans this Thursday in Washington D.C.

Under California’s delegate rules, candidates select their own delegate slates, and Trump put McCarthy in to represent his Central Valley congressional district.

Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech venture capitalist who was an early investor in Facebook and a past backer of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, signed up as a Trump delegate in House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco district.

David Horowitz, a conservative activist, and Richard Grenell, a former spokesman for past U.S. ambassadors to the United States, also are slated to be Trump delegates.

Other notable Trump delegates from the California congressional delegation include Reps. Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter, who was one of the earliest House members to endorse the Manhattan billionaire.
