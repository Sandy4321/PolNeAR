De Blasio: Trust Bratton on security, not 'blowhard' Trump.

Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected criticism from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that shutting down a controversial intelligence-gathering unit within the New York Police Department made the city less safe.

De Blasio said the move was made by NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton and said, “Who are you going to trust on security and keeping people safe?”

De Blasio, speaking on WOR710, called Trump a “blowhard,” and said his anti-Muslim remarks were priceless “propaganda” for terrorist groups like Islamic State.

Trump recently said he would "absolutely" require Muslims in America to register with the government.

When asked by a reporter whether this differed from Nazi Germany requiring Jews to register, Trump reportedly said, "You tell me," repeatedly, before he stopped responding to the reporter.

De Blasio also repeated his claim that “profit-making” was the motivation for some technology companies that are offering encryption technology that cannot be accessed by law enforcement during an investigation.

When asked by a host if the revelations by Edward Snowden about intelligence gathering efforts in any way led to the Paris attacks, which was seen as an intelligence failure, de Blasio said, “I have not heard that particular concern” from New York law enforcement officials.

But, he added, “We are, in effect, in a war, and in a war, loose lips sink ships.”

De Blasio repeatedly said New York is safe thanks to 14 years of anti-terrorism efforts by the NYPD, new technology, and a better working relationship with federal parters and local residents.
