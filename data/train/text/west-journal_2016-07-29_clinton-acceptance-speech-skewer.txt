Clinton Acceptance Speech Skewered By Carly Fiorina.

On Thursday evening Hillary Clinton delivered her acceptance speech as the Democratic nominee, seeking to prove her credentials while painting her chief political rival, Donald Trump, as a man too unqualified for the job.

“A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,” said the Democratic nominee.

Yet while Clinton referenced Trump’s antics on Twitter as a clear sign he’s unfit to posses our nation’s nuclear codes, many would likely point out Clinton is drawing such criticisms from a poisoned well.

From her inability as secretary of state to secure the lives of those under her charge in Benghazi, to being “extreme careless” in the handling of classified information – as described by FBI Director James Comey – many believe Clinton has already proven herself incapable on matters of national security.

In an attempt to cover up her email scandal, Clinton also became the only candidate thus far to lie under oath at a congressional testimony, making the disparity between the two candidates’ track record rather stunning.

In response to Clinton’s address, former Hewlett-Packard CEO and presidential candidate Carly Fiorina opened up on Twitter, reminding Americans of Clinton’s most infamous statements and lies.
