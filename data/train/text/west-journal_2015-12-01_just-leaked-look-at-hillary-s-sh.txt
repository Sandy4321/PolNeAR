Just Leaked: Look At Hillary’s Shocking Response To Learning 6 Soldiers Died.

In the most recent batch of Hillary Clinton emails released by the State Department, the candidate for the nation’s next commander-in-chief appeared to show particular callousness regarding the death of six American soldiers.

Clinton top aide Huma Abedin emailed the then secretary of state in December 2011, informing her of the death of the American soldiers, who were serving in the Middle East. Clinton’s response was: “Is Dalton Brody off Conn or Wisconsin?” Dalton Brody is a Washington, DC, gifts and accessories store, which sells such items as leather goods, crystal, and pottery, according to its website.

According to Fox News, the State Department reported finding an additional 328 emails containing classified information in them, which brings the total to nearly 1000.Watch the latest video at <a href="http://video.foxnews.com">video.foxnews.com</a>.

In the spring after the email scandal broke, Clinton emphatically proclaimed at a press conference, “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.” The presidential candidate reiterated: “I’m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.”

The candidate changed her story a few months later, after her initial statement was shown to be false, stating that she had not sent or received any emails that were “marked classified at the time.”

So far, approximately two-thirds of the 55,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over to the State Department have been made public. “The emails released Monday were largely sent or received in 2012 and 2013, though some are from as far back as 2009,” CBS News reported.

In May, a federal judge, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, ordered the State Department to review and to release the Clinton emails in batches every 30 days.
