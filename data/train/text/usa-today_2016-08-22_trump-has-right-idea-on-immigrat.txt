Trump has right idea on immigration policy.

LETTERS.

Donald Trump understands that the threat to American society is not multiculturalism, but rather the type of immigrants we accept.

Muslim emigration to the West has been troublesome. The majority will not join the mainstream of their adopted countries, but replicate their cultures and conflicts, and establish enclaves where sharia law overrides the law of the land.

We need only look to the Islamic invasion of Europe. Immigrants, whether refugees, economic migrants or terrorists, have not adapted. They are attracted by overly generous welfare systems and will cause economic chaos.

In Britain, for example, the Islamic Emirates Project named Birmingham, Bradford, Derby, Dewsbury, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Lutton, Manchester, Sheffield, as well as Waltham Forest in northeast London and Tower Hamlets in East London as territories to be targeted for blanket sharia rule.

In France, there are areas where those who enter must conform to Islamic norms. In England, France, Sweden and Norway, Jews fear for their safety and are leaving in record numbers.

In our universities, Jewish students are harassed by the Muslim student groups.

Trump knows we must rethink our immigration policies.
