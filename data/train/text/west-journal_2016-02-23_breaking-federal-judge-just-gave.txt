Breaking: Federal Judge Just Gave Hillary Some Of The Worst News – She’s Going To HATE It.

A federal judge granted Judicial Watch’s request for discovery into whether Hillary Clinton and the State Department deliberately thwarted the government watchdog’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests over a six-year time period.

The order by U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan came as part of a FOIA lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch to obtain information about the controversial employment status of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who served simultaneously as deputy chief of staff to Clinton at the State Department, and as an employee of the Clinton Foundation.

Judge Sullivan made his ruling over objections by the State Department, according to a press release from Judicial Watch. The judge is also considering whether to order the department to subpoena all emails on the clinton.com email system.

“Judge Sullivan’s ruling granting Judicial Watch’s request for discovery is a major victory for the public’s right to know the truth about Hillary Clinton’s email system,” said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton. “The court-ordered discovery will help determine why the State Department and Mrs. Clinton, even despite receiving numerous FOIA requests, kept the record system secret for years.”

“Sullivan set an April 15 deadline for parties to litigate a detailed investigative plan — subject to court approval — that would reach well beyond the limited and carefully worded explanations of the use of the private server that department and Clinton officials have given,” the Washington Post reported.

“There has been a constant drip, drip, drip of declarations. When does it stop?,” the judge said, according to the Post. “This case is about the public’s right to know.”

Sullivan also said the State Department’s handling of the email controversy has created at least a “reasonable suspicion” the public’s access to documents under FOIA has been undermined.
