Former AG Mukasey at RNC: Clinton email scandal disqualifies her for presidency.

CLEVELAND, July 19 (UPI) — Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey told delegates at the Republican National Convention that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server should disqualify her from becoming president.

Mukasey, the Republican attorney general under former President George W. Bush, criticized Clinton’s email use, which an FBI investigation said was “extremely careless” but did not warrant criminal charges.

“Hillary Clinton is asking the people of this country … to make her the first president of the United States to take the oath to protect the Constitution after already having violated it,” Mukasey said.

Mukasey said the email scandal is only the latest issue in her political career that should give voters pause.

“Over the years, Hillary Clinton has done a lot of things and said a lot of things to show why she shouldn’t be president of the United States,” he said. “How she treated and what she did with government secrets when she was secretary of state and what she said about what she did both before and after she got caught exquisitely sums up the case against her presidency.”
