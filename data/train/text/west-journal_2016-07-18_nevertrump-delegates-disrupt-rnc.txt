NeverTrump Delegates Disrupt RNC After Rules Report Is Presented.

As the Republican National Convention kicked off Monday in Cleveland, it was clear from the outset that presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump still faces serious backlash from critics within the party. A number of GOP delegates have petitioned for a rule change allowing them to vote their conscience instead of serving as a rubber stamp for their home states’ choice.

Making a final effort to effect such change, anti-Trump delegates attempted to secure a vote on the issue. Though media reports and party sources described the push as nearly impossible to pull off, protesting delegates nevertheless made their point.

That forecast appeared accurate when the rules committee report was finalized and denied the change being sought. According to exclusive reports from the convention, anti-Trump delegates were still determined to disrupt the convention proceedings.

M. Dane Waters, whose Delegates Unbound group has been at the forefront of this effort, predicted that delegates would “take this fight to the floor.”

Norvell Rose, reporting for Western Journalism from Cleveland this week, was on hand to witness the moment they did exactly that.

A revolt on the floor reportedly began shortly after the committee’s report was presented and caused a temporary disruption in the day’s scheduled events.

When those voting “yes” were declared the majority following a floor vote on the rules’ passage, anti-Trump delegates reportedly erupted in a chorus of booing and loud chants of “no.”

At one point, the convention’s band was instructed to begin playing as the fracas played out on the floor. Shortly after the display, prominent Virginia anti-Trump delegate Ken Cuccinelli was surrounded by inquiring attendees.

Cuccinelli reportedly reacted to the decision by tossing his credentials on the convention floor and leaving.

A motion for a roll-call vote on the rules has since been denied.
