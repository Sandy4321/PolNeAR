Drivers Are So Shocked By These 3 Words On Highway Warning Sign They Turn Around Just To Record It.

Highway motorists are used to seeing the digital road sign warning of accidents or road work ahead, but those traveling on Interstate 15 west of Los Angeles over the weekend received a recommendation for president instead.

Local news affiliate ABC 7 is reporting that a husband and wife were surprised to see a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) sign on Friday night at an exit in Corona (about 45 miles east of L.A.), which read, “Inland Empire supports Donald Trump. Merry Xmas. Vote Donald Trump.” The Inland Empire refers to those communities east of Los Angeles and west of the Sierra Madre mountain range.

After seeing the sign, Dann and Nikki Worden of Corona took the next exit and went around to shoot video of the sign, which was since gone viral on Facebook with over 400,000 views.

Caltrans told ABC 7 that someone had reprogrammed the sign, which as of Sunday had been reprogrammed back. Rather than receiving recommendations for their presidential vote, motorists in neighboring Arizona were treated to a series of Star Wars themed driving advisories.

According to AZCentral, one Arizona Department of Transportation sign read, “Trust in the Force, but always buckle up.” Another advised, “Aggressive Driving is the path to the Dark Side,” and “Speeding you are, Arrested you will be.”
