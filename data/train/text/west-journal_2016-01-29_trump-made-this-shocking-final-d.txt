Trump Made This Shocking Final Demand To Fox Right Before Debate – Refused Immediately.

On Thursday night, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told the audience at his fundraiser for veterans that he and Fox News had multiple conversations Thursday but that nothing could change his mind about his decision to boycott the debated hosted by Fox.

At one point, Trump said Fox executives were calling “every 15 minutes.”

Fox told a slightly different tale.

“Roger Ailes (Fox News Chairman and CEO) had three brief conversations with Donald Trump on Thursday about possibly appearing at the debate – there were not multiple calls placed by Ailes to Trump,” Fox News said in a statement.

“In the course of those conversations, we acknowledged his concerns about a satirical observation we made in order to quell the attacks on Megyn Kelly, and prevent her from being smeared any further.”

“Furthermore, Trump offered to appear at the debate upon the condition that FOX News contribute $5 million to his charities. We explained that was not possible and we could not engage in a quid pro quo, nor could any money change hands for any reason,” the statement said.

Trump did not at any time Thursday mention requesting a donation from Fox.

He did tell CNN that during his conversations with Fox officials he received an apology from a Fox executive, though he did not say who made the apology specifically. During the event Thursday night and during his interview with CNN, Trump indicated that by the time an apology was tendered, it has too late for him to have canceled his rally. Trump said the event has raised more than $6 million for veterans.
