Rose Bowl skywriters blast Trump.

PASADENA, Calif., Jan. 1 (UPI) — A handful of skywriters in Pasadena, Calif., are definitely not voting for Donald Trump.

Friday morning, as the Rose Bowl parade rolled through Pasadena, CNN reported at least six skywriting planes filled the skies with anti-Trump messages.

“America is great! Trump is disgusting,” read one. “Anybody but Trump,” was another. One message read “anybodybuttrump.us,” a website linked to a group called the “We The People Foundation.”

Iowa, the first state to caucus on Feb. 1, is set to play Stanford, Calif., in the 102nd Rose Bowl later Friday.

One Republican presidential hopeful, Carly Fiorina, says despite being a Stanford alumna, she plans to root for Iowa.
