Chelsea Clinton, husband expecting second child.

NEW YORK, Dec. 22 (UPI) — Chelsea Clinton announced she and husband Marc Mezvinsky are expected their second child this summer.

Clinton, 35, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said on Twitter on Monday, in reference to her first child, a girl born Sept, 26, 2014, “Next summer, Charlotte is going to be a big sister! Feeling very blessed & grateful this holiday season.”
