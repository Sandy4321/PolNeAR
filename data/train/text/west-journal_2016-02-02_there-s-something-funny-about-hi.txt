There’s Something Funny About Hillary’s Iowa Victory That Has Many Suspicious.

Flipping a coin is supposed to be one of the fairest ways of making a decision, with an equal chance of the coin landing on heads or tails. However, when coins were flipped to decide a tight Iowa caucus races Monday night, things did not work out so evenly.

Coin flips were used to decide at least six counties in Monday’s Democratic caucuses, according to a report in the Des Moines Register. Each coin flip resulted in the awarding of one delegate.   Using a coin flip to award delegates was not an impromptu decision, but part of the rules when precincts are deadlocked on a decision. As of Tuesday morning, different media sources were reporting different numbers of cases where a coin flip was used. In some cases, the coin flip was recorded on video.

However there was a common thread among all those cases where a coin flip was used. In all six instances where a coin toss was used to determine the winner of the delegate, Hillary Clinton won over Sen. Bernie Sanders.

TheBlaze did the math on that feat, and found that the odds of winning all six comes out to 1 in 64, or 1.56 percent.

TheBlaze also did the math about the outcome of those coin flips and their significance in the overall tally.

“Clinton’s final delegate count was 699.57, according to the Iowa Democratic Party. Sanders’ was 695.49,” The Blaze reported. “If Sanders had won half of the coin tosses and split the six delegates three and three with Clinton, he would have finished at 698.49 delegates to Clinton’s 696.57.”

Readers of TheBlaze were quick to condemn the outcome.

“If any human involvement occurs in an election, the Clintons will find a way to corrupt it,” wrote one commenter.
