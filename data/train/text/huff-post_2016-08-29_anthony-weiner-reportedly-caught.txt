Anthony Weiner Reportedly Caught In Yet Another Sext Scandal.

Former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), whose political career ended in disgrace after two sexting scandals, was apparently unable to put down his phone.
Weiner, 51, who’s married to top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, allegedly sent lurid tweets and photos of his crotch to another woman, the New York Post reported. One of the raunchy selfies included his young son in the background.
The woman who received the former congressman’s photos has reportedly been chatting with him online since January 2015. She sent screen shots of their conversations to the Post and spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity.
Although Weiner admitted to the newspaper that he and the woman had “been friends for some time,” he claimed they had never met in person.

In 2011, Weiner resigned from Congress ― and became the fodder of late-night comedians ― after he accidentally posted a sexually explicit image of himself on Twitter. Although Weiner attempted to revive his political career in 2013 by running for New York City mayor, he lost the election amid a second sexting scandal (the one where he used the alias Carlos Danger).
Afterward, Weiner mostly dropped out of the public eye, giving only occasional interviews with the media. He announced that he was undergoing therapy and vowed to focus on being a better father.

“Being a dad, that’s my job,” Weiner said in May on the podcast “Here’s the Thing.”
In recent years, Weiner opened a consulting firm, became involved in a nonprofit restaurant and acted in the Syfy movie “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!” This past spring, his sexual and political escapades were featured in the documentary “Weiner.”
