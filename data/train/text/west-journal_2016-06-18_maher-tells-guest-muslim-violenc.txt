Maher Tells Guest Muslim Violence is Beyond Compare.

When guests on his Friday night show made the point that individuals other than Muslims kill people in mass shootings or acts of destruction, Real Time host Bill Maher said it was wrong to compare the violence of Christians with that of Muslims.

Retired Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson started Maher’s rant when he brought up the Oklahoma City bombing and later said, “It’s not just Muslims shooting people.”

“That is a false equivalency!” Maher replied. “How many Muslim-inspired terrorist attacks have there been… and how many Christian-inspired?”

Maher was not done with his train of thought. He returned to it later after Business Insider senior editor Josh Barro noted that the odds of dying in a terrorist attack were very low, and that Americans should worry more about other things that might actually kill them, such as obesity.

Maher was still focused on Muslims.

“Except, they are trying to get a nuclear weapon and I don’t think there are any Christian groups that trying to obtain a nuclear weapon, sir,” Maher said.

“No one is saying that the only bad things happen in the Muslim world, we are saying, I am saying, lots of people…that there — you have to go where the preponderance of it is. And there is no doubt that it — that most of it happens in this sphere,” said Maher.

Maher also suggested American politicians don’t fully understand Muslims.

“Hillary Clinton said this week, freedom-loving Muslims. Well, this is what Bush — this was his mistake, to think, all people in the world want to be just like us. I don’t know if freedom, as we think of it, is the same way they think of it,” he said.
