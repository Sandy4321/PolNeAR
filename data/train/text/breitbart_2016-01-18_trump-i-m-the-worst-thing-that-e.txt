Trump: ‘I’m the Worst Thing That Ever Happened to the Establishment.’

Monday at Liberty University in Lynchburg, VA, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump addressed the students of the Christian university in a wide-ranging speech that included Trump vowing to protect Christianity.

Also during that speech, Trump explained how he would be free of conflicts of interest given he isn’t taking large sums of money from certain interests in the political process. According to Trump, he was once part of the so-called establishment, but is now “the worst thing that ever happened to the establishment.”

“I know this game better than anybody,” Trump said. “I’ve been playing this game for a long time, folks, from the other side. I changed sides. I was total establishment. Now I’m like the worst thing that ever happened to the establishment because I understand the game. So now, they go to, let’s say, Jeb — they say Mr. President, this is very bad thing. I agree it is bad, we have to do this, we can’t allow this to happen. Then he is going to get a call from his lobbyist or his special interest, ‘Mr. President, they gave you $5 million. You can’t not make this deal’… Another one is going to call, Mr. President, they gave you $2 million. You’ve got to take care of Ford. Alright, I’ll do it. That’s the end. We lose the jobs and all the different things. With me, they’re going to equal.”
