Billionaire Mark Cuban Just Revealed Who He’d Pick Between Cruz And Trump — It Might Surprise You.

Eight years after backing Barack Obama, billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is once again sizing up the presidential field in order to determine his favorite candidate. Appearing at Austin’s annual South by Southwest festival, the investor took several questions from attendees — including one soliciting his views on the GOP primary race.

In describing fellow billionaire Donald Trump, Cuban said he sees someone without the intellectual curiosity needed to serve as commander in chief.

“You’ve got to be able to adapt,” he said of Trump, “whether you’re a politician or you’re a business person or you’re an entrepreneur. You’ve got to be curious, you’ve got to want to learn, you’ve got to be excited about always learning. And that’s what I want in a candidate — someone who’s learning and evolving.”

Nevertheless, Cuban said that in a race between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, he would support the former. He went on to call Cruz “the absolutely worst politician in Texas.”

As evidence of his allegation, Cuban seemed to rely on an ad hominem attack against Cruz by Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.

“If you’re in the Senate and another senator says you could get shot and nobody in the Senate would come to your aid,” the investor said, “that’s even worse.”

Cuban also complained that Cruz is too principled, suggesting the first-term senator sees issues as “absolutely black and white.”
