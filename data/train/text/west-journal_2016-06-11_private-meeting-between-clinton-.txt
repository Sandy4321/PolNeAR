Private Meeting Between Clinton, Warren Prompts VP Speculation.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had been talking with officials from the Hillary Clinton campaign for weeks about her endorsing the presumptive Democrat nominee for President. This reportedly culminated in a meeting at Clinton’s Whitehaven residence in Washington, D.C., Friday.

The meeting got people talking about whether or not this could mean a Clinton-Warren ticket.

The media circus was in full effect for the meeting as camera trucks were parked outside and cable TV staked out the residence for wall-to-wall coverage. Footage captured Warren getting out of a blue SUV with legislative director Jon Donenberg and the two walked into Clinton’s home together.

Warren exited the meeting around 11:45 a.m. on Friday and Clinton left shortly thereafter for a speech at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Neither Warren nor Clinton spoke with reporters.

On Thursday, after remaining neutral throughout the primary process, Warren appeared with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and officially endorsed Clinton, saying, “I think having a fighter in the lead — a female fighter in the lead — is exactly what this country needs.”

The endorsement was one the Clinton campaign had long coveted because they are hoping a stamp of approval from Warren, who is very popular with the Democrats’ progressive base, will help convince supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders to support Clinton for president in November.

At one point during the interview, Maddow tried to press Warren on whether or not she would be Clinton’s running mate, but the senator insisted she hadn’t discussed that with Clinton.
