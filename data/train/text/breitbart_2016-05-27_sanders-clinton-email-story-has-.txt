Sanders: Clinton Email Story Has Moved.

Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stated that the story on rival Democratic candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails has moved on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time.”

Sanders was asked by host Bill Maher, who is supporting Sanders, but has previously dismissed the story about Clinton’s emails, “Now, you famously said, in one of the first debates with Hillary Clinton, oh, I’m tired of hearing about the emails. And you know, for a long time, I was tired of hearing about the emails, and I still don’t think she committed some horrible crime, but that story has moved a little bit, has it not?”

Sanders responded, “It has. But this is what I also think, there is enormous frustration on the part of the American people with the way we do politics in this country. And what most politicians do is say, I’m great. You’re terrible. Vote for me. The other guy’s the scum of the earth, blah, blah, blah. But, you know what, people are hurting in this country. You know, our middle class is disappearing. We’ve got a lot of poverty. We don’t have healthcare for all people. People want us to talk about their lives and their issues and just not spend our whole lives attacking our opponents.”

Later in the show, after the Sanders interview concluded, Maher stated of the email scandal that the State Department IG’s report “wasn’t good.” Adding, “Now, like with all Clinton scandals, what they actually do is never that bad. … It’s always how they handle it. And I think what the problem is, is that these two cut their teeth in Arkansas, and they got used to being able to fool rubes…easily, and it doesn’t work that way in DC.”
