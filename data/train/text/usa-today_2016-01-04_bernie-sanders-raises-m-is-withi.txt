Bernie Sanders raises $33M; 
Is within $4M of Clinton's haul.

Bernie Sanders raised more than $33million during the last three months of 2015 to underwrite his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign announced Saturday. His haul puts him within $4million of the $37million raised by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton during the same period.

In all, the Vermont senator has raised nearly $73million for his White House battle, campaign officials said. Aides said more than 1 million donors made more than 2.5million contributions to Sanders' campaign, surpassing President Obama's previous record for individual contributions. (Obama had collected 2.2million contributions at this stage in his re-election campaign.)

"This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics," Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said in a statement. "What we are showing is that we can run a strong national campaign without a super PAC and without depending on millionaires and billionaires for their support."

Campaign aides said the average donation during the October-to-December fundraising quarter was $27.16. Sanders appears to be spending more heavily as the first round of voting nears. His campaign said he ended December with $28.4million in available cash out of the nearly $73million raised.

Clinton, who collected $112million in 2015 for her nomination battle, had a bigger cash balance at year's end -- nearly $38million, according to figures her campaign released Friday.

Two of the Republicans seeking the presidency have released their fundraising totals. Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz raised $23million and $20million, respectively, in the last quarter. Cruz's haul is a big jump from the $12.2million he raised during the third quarter of the year and comes as he has emerged as a serious rival to Republican front-runner Donald Trump in Iowa.

Candidates have until Jan. 31, the eve of the Iowa caucuses, to disclose fundraising details.
