Cruz and Trump tied in Texas poll.

Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in Texas, well ahead of their nearest competitors.

According to an online University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll out Thursday, the Texas senator and business mogul each have the support of 27 percent of likely Republican voters in the state. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson trails them at 13 percent. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio comes in at 9 percent.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina are all tied at 4 percent. Everyone else is at 2 percent or below.

The poll has bad news for Bush, who has been attempting to right a struggling campaign — 25 percent of likely Republican voters say they would “definitely not support" him, the highest for any candidate. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham comes in second, with 22 percent saying they would definitely not support him, former New York Gov. George Pataki at 20 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore at 18 percent. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both get 16 percent.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton doubles Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ share of support; 61 percent to 30 percent, respectively. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley gets 1 percent support.

Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig, who has since dropped out of the race, leads with “definitely not support” with 6 percent in the poll. Clinton and Sanders have 5 percent, and O’Malley has 4 percent.

The survey of 1,200 registered voters was taken Oct. 30 to Nov. 8 online with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points. Out of 542 registered Republican primary voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.21 percentage points. Out of registered 459 Democratic primary voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.57 percentage points.
