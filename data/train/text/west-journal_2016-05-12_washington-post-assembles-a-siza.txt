Washington Post Assembles ‘A Sizable Army’ Of Reporters To Take Down Trump.

The Washington Post has put together a rather sizable army of reporters to investigate every facet of Donald Trump’s life.

The initiative comes under orders by the Washington Post’s new owner, Jeff Bezos, who is also the founder of Amazon and a Democratic Party mega-donor.

Bob Woodward, an associate editor for the Post, revealed Wednesday that 20 staffers have been assigned to the task, whose findings will be released in a book this coming August.

“There’s a lot we don’t know,” Woodward told the National Association of Realtors at its Washington convention. “We have 20 people working on Trump, we’re going to do a book, we’re doing articles about every phase of his life.”

According to Woodward, “The New York real estate world is more complex than the CIA,” presumably meaning this will be a focal point of the investigation.

While it has been known for some time that this book was in the works, what was not entirely known was how extensive the research would be or how many staffers had been assigned to the task.

Back in April, the Post announced its intention to do a full investigation of Trump’s life and release the tell-all regardless of whether he became the Republican nominee.

In a statement released by Post Editor-in-Chief Martin Baron, the full details and motivations were discussed.

“Donald Trump is a presidential candidate unlike any we’ve ever seen before,” said Baron. “His candidacy and his positions have defied all conventions and upended the political landscape. Given that he could ascend to the most powerful position in the world, Trump’s life and career deserve to be explored in the greatest depth.

He continued, “That’s what we intend to do, with a huge investment of reportorial and editing resources and with a staff that consistently has led the field in covering his volatile candidacy.”
