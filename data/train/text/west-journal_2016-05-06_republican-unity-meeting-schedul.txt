Republican ‘Unity’ Meeting Scheduled For Next Week.

After a day of tensions between two of the nation’s highest-profile Republicans, House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office announced Friday that Ryan will meet with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday.

“I’ve invited ‪@realDonaldTrump for a meeting with GOP leaders next week, and I look forward to the discussion,” Ryan tweeted Friday.

A statement from Ryan’s office indicated the invitation was accepted.

“Having both said we need to unify the party, Speaker Ryan has invited Donald Trump to meet with members of the House Republican leadership in Washington on Thursday morning to begin a discussion about the kind of Republican principles and ideas that can win the support of the American people this November,” Ryan’s office said in a statement.

Trump, Ryan and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus will also hold a separate meeting.

During the Republican presidential primaries, Ryan voiced displeasure with some of Trump’s proposals on immigration, in particular his proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.

On Thursday, Ryan said he was “not ready” to support Trump’s campaign for president, and suggested that Trump needs to take the first steps to show he will unify the party. Later that day, Trump fired back a response saying he would not support Ryan’s agenda and suggesting that politicians should do what is best for the American people.

On Friday, Trump was still publicly miffed over Ryan’s lack of support.

Trump said Friday that Ryan’s refusal to support him was “not a good thing” and “something the party should get solved quickly.”

“I mean, he talks about unity, but what is this about unity?” Trump added during his appearance on Fox and Friends. “With millions of people coming into the party, obviously I’m saying the right thing.”
