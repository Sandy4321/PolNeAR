Trump Just Announced Who He ‘Would Love’ To See Run For President – It May Surprise You.

After spending months trying to eliminate everyone else on the Republican side from the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump has finally found someone he would like to enter the contest — fellow billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Western Journalism reported on Saturday that Bloomberg is considering a third party run for the White House and that Trump’s success, coupled with that of Democrat Bernie Sanders, were factors in his decision to consider running.

“I would love to have Michael Bloomberg run, I would love that competition. I think I’d do very well against it,” Trump said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press.

Trump was even more emphatic Monday when he spoke to CNN about the subject.

“I’d beat him,” Trump said. “I would love him to do it actually. I love the competition. I love the competition. I would love for Michael to do it,” Trump said.

Trump explained his reasoning in an appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation.

“He’s very opposite on me with guns, and he’s opposite on pro-life, and he’s opposite on a lot of things, so I would love to have Michael get in the race,” Trump said.

“Michael’s been a friend of mine over the years. Perhaps we’re not friends anymore,” Trump said. “You know, he’s wanted to do this for a long time, and he never pulled the trigger. We’ll see if he does right now. But I would personally love to compete with Michael Bloomberg.”

Although Bloomberg is not yet a candidate, Trump sent a typical Trump-style campaign jab the billionaire’s way by suggesting that Bloomberg was personally worth less than the $36.5 billion estimated by Forbes. A spokesman for Bloomberg had no response.
