Graham: Trump’s ‘Incredibly Hateful Rhetoric’ Destroying GOP’s Chance to Win Presidency.

Thursday at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference in Washington, D.C., Republican, presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called out his rival Donald Trump for alienating Hispanics, which he believes will make it impossible for a Republican to win the presidency in 2016.

Graham said, “How many of you believe we lose elections because we’re not hard-ass enough on immigration? I believe we’re losing the Hispanic vote because they think we don’t like them.”

He continued, “I believe it’s not about turning out evangelical Christians but about repairing the damage done by incredibly hateful rhetoric driving a wall between us and the fastest growing demographic in America who should be Republicans. I believe Donald Trump is destroying the Republican Party’s chance to win an election that we can’t afford to lose.”

He added, “Now it’s not self-deportation, it’s forced deportation. We’re literally going to round them all up? Does that sound familiar to you? Everyone of them, including their American citizen children. That is the leader of the Republican Party. You think you are going to win an election with that kind of garbage?”
