CNN Just Responded To Trump’s Massive Debate Demand In A Way That Could Cause Mayhem.

On Monday night, in an apparent attempt to by Donald Trump to influence the tone of the next Republican presidential debate hosted by CNN, Trump told a rally audience that he would only do the debate if CNN donated 5 million dollars to charity.

The old adage, “I mean what I say and say what I mean” demeanor may have quickly disappeared from Trump’s face when he got word today that his demands have been answered.

According to Variety, CNN has gotten back to Trump with their response to Trump’s demand to have a charity benefit from his presence at the next debates. “No,” replied Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide, said simply. Zucker responded by saying that the network doesn’t pay for candidates to attend the debates. It’s not the first time Trump tried get the network to give in exchange for his presence at a debate. In September, Trump did the same thing.

Back in September, he wrote a letter to Zucker asking that all the proceeds, from the first CNN Republican presidential debate, go to charity.  Zucker didn’t officially respond to Trump’s initial request for the network to give to charities. Trump went to that debate, and he’ll probably go to the debate on December 15th, because, according to Trump, the media would call him a “chicken” if he didn’t.

The next GOP debate is scheduled for December 15th.   It will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Venetian Hotel and Casino and will be aired on CNN, with or without Donald Trump in attendance.
