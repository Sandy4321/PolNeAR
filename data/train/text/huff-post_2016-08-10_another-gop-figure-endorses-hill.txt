Another GOP Figure Endorses Hillary Clinton.

Some Republicans are so vehemently opposed to electing Donald Trump as the next president that they’re endorsing Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. 
Former Rep. Chris Shays (R-Conn.) was pro John Kasich while the Ohio governor was in the running, he said Wednesday morning on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
“Hillary is my next choice. Not hard to figure out. Donald Trump lost me a long time ago,” he said. “He does and says everything my mom and dad taught me not to say or do, he doesn’t understand the basic requirements of being president of the United States. And frankly, he’s dangerous.”
Another Connecticut former lawmaker, Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), also stated his intention to vote for Clinton on Wednesday.
And although they haven’t come out in support of Clinton, many other members of the GOP are not mincing words in their opposition to Trump.
People like Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Mark Kirk (Ill.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) are on the list, as are Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), Rep. Richard Hanna (N.Y.), Rep. Carlos Curbelo (Fla.), Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) and Charlie Dent (Pa.).
Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) joined the group this week, publishing an op-ed in The Washington Post hammering his “unsuitability for office.”
Anti-Trump sentiment extends to Republicans outside of Congress, too.
Fifty of the nation’s top Republican national security officers signed an open letter Monday making it clear that they’re not voting for Trump.
Other prominent Republicans, like Richard Armitage, Henry Paulson and Brent Scowcroft ― three former George W. Bush administration big shots ― have also said they’re supporting Clinton. 
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.
