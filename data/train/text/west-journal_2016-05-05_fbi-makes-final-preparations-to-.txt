FBI Makes Final Preparations To Interview Hillary Clinton.

The FBI is reportedly making arrangements to interview Hillary Clinton as it nears the end of its investigation into her use of a private, unsecured server to conduct government business.

As reported by Western Journalism, investigators found over 2,200 emails from Clinton’s server containing classified information. The FBI investigation is focused on whether federal laws regarding the handling of government documents have been violated.

CNN reported Thursday that the FBI has recently interviewed key Clinton aides including Huma Abedin. Additionally, former Clinton employee, Bryan Pagliano, who helped set up the former secretary of state’s server, was granted immunity and has been interviewed by the agency as part of the inquiry.

“FBI officials overseeing the probe now expect to complete their work in the next few weeks and then turn over the findings to the Justice Department, which will make a final decision on whether to bring charges against anyone,” according to CNN.

One final step in the investigation will be bringing Clinton herself in for questioning. The FBI will coordinate with the campaign and her Secret Service detail to ensure the meeting takes place privately, ideally, as far as the Clinton team is concerned, without the media aware of its time or location.

Clinton stated earlier this week that she is willing to sit down with the investigators. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told Politico, “From the start, Hillary Clinton has offered to answer any questions that would help the Justice Department complete its review, and we hope and expect that anyone else who is asked would do the same. We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place.”
