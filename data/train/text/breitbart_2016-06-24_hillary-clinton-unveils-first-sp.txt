Hillary Clinton unveils first Spanish campaign ad.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (UPI) — Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton unveiled her first Spanish-language campaign ad, featuring Hispanics telling their family stories and criticizing Donald Trump’s immigration proposals.

The ad, entitled “Nuestra Historia (Our History),” features five Hispanic-Americans with varying national heritage speaking in Spanish and talking about their family history in the United States.

The 60-second spot will air on the Spanish-language network Univision during Sunday’s final of the Copa Americana soccer tournament between Argentina and Chile, which is expected to draw a large Latino television audience.

The ad includes a clip of a Trump television interview, in which he says he will assemble a “deportation force” to round up illegal immigrants.

The Clinton campaign did not release the amount it is paying to air the commercial.
