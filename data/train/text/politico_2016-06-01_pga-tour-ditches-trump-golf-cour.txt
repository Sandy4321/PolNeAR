PGA Tour ditches Trump golf course for Mexico.

The PGA Tour is leaving Donald Trump and heading for Mexico.

The Trump National Doral Resort Miami has hosted a PGA Tour event since 1962, but the tour will leave the Miami course starting in 2017 and replace it with an event in Mexico City. Trump National Doral had most recently been the host of the WGC-Cadillac Championship, played in March, but Cadillac declined to renew its sponsorship of the event and the PGA could not find a new sponsor to replace it.

News of the PGA’s move was first reported by the Miami Herald.

"I just heard that the PGA Tour is taking their tournament out of Miami and moving it to Mexico," Trump said of the move during an interview on Fox News Tuesday night. “Cadillac's been a great sponsor, but they're moving it to Mexico. They're moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance.”

“They're moving it to Mexico City,” Trump continued. “And I'm saying, you know, what's going on here? It is so sad when you look at what's going on with our country."

Trump purchased Doral in 2012 and has invested in significant refurbishments to the 800-acre property. The real estate mogul listed the resort in his financial disclosure as a liability with a mortgage worth more than $50 million. The club has been a significant money-maker for Trump, however — he reported earning $132 million from the club on his financial disclosure form, making it by far the most valuable of his golf course properties.
