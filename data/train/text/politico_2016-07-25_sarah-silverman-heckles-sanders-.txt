Sarah Silverman heckles Sanders supporters: 'You're being ridiculous.'

Comedian Sarah Silverman was booed and shouted down by Bernie Sanders supporters after telling holdouts for the Vermont senator that they were “being ridiculous.”

Silverman, herself a Sanders supporter during the primary, incurred a wave of boos upon saying, “Hillary heard the passion of the people.”

She continued, “I am proud to be a part of Bernie’s movement. And part of that movement is to make sure Hillary Clinton is our next president of the United States.”

As the crowd began to chant, Silverman was joined on stage again by Minnesota Sen. Al Franken and joked, “Bernie or Bust people, you’re being ridiculous,” drawing loud jeers and “BERNIE!” chants.

“Look at what you did,” Franken said. Silverman responded, “Thank God they can fix this in post-[production].”

They continued to awkwardly veer off script, saying they were being told to stretch their time on stage before the next act.

“What I love about us both being here is, it’s like we’re like a bridge,” Franken said. “Well you were for Bernie and I’m for Hillary so we’re like a bridge over troubled…” he said, not finishing his joke.

Silverman interjected, “Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Paul Simon," who proceeded to perform "Bridge Over Troubled Water."
