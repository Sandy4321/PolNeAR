'2nd Amendment people' his secret weapon, Trump hints; 
Says Clinton would stack Supreme Court against gun advocates.

Donald Trump on Tuesday seemed to imply that people with guns could stop Hillary Clinton as president from appointing anti-gun judges.

Trump, speaking at a rally in Wilmington, N.C., warned that Clinton opposes the Second Amendment and would appoint Supreme Court justices who would block gun rights. There is an opening following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and Republicans have refused to vote on President Obama's nominee.

"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks," Trump said before adding: "Though the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know."

Minutes later, the Trump campaign  issued a statement saying that Trump meant people who support the Second Amendment are unified and will vote together.

"It's called the power of unification -- 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won't be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump," Trump's senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in the statement.

The National Rifle Association, which has endorsed Trump, used the comments to urge people to vote for him on  Election Day.

Democrats -- including Clinton -- quickly accused Trump of suggesting violence against the Democratic nominee.

"This is simple -- what Trump is saying is dangerous," said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook in a statement.

Progressive super PACs immediately jumped on the comments.

American Bridge President Jessica Mackler issued a statement saying his comment "has absolutely no place in American democracy" and said Republican leaders will have a "day of reckoning."

Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton super PAC, emailed  a link to the video with one sentence: "THIS IS NOT OK."
