Networks Didn’t Cut From Donald Trump’s Speech Once To Air Hillary Clinton.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton gave a stump speech Tuesday night, but chances are you didn’t see it, since none of the major TV networks covered it. They were all glued to GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump’s rambling speech/press conference/self-promotional event happening at the same time.

Clinton’s speech was pretty boring, to be sure. It didn’t have the rowdy feel that’s so characteristic of Trump’s events. Clinton, speaking in Ohio, talked through policy issues that matter to this crowd: Her vote for the auto bailout. Her vow to go after companies that ship jobs overseas while claiming U.S. tax breaks. Her fight for quality child care.

But if you wanted to see her event, and not stay up past 10 p.m. searching for a replay, the only way to watch was on CSPAN. The cable news networks — MSNBC, CNN, Fox Business Network and Fox News — all stuck with Trump talking at length about his financial successes, taking shots at Marco Rubio (“Little Marco”) and Ted Cruz (“Lyin Ted”), insulting reporters while taking questions from them, and promoting Trump-branded steaks, wine, magazines, golf courses, vodka and water.

MSNBC, for one, did replay Clinton’s speech later.

CNN barely even mentioned Clinton’s remarks and went right back to its panel of guests.

Fox News’ Bret Baier noticed that none of the networks cut away for Clinton. He commented that his network “held on” Trump during her event. But Fox didn’t replay Clinton’s speech afterward, at least not immediately.[10:29.]
