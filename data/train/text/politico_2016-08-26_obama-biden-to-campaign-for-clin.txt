Obama, Biden to campaign for Clinton in September.

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine in September at separate events in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Democratic nominee's campaign announced Friday.

Biden will appear on behalf of the Democratic ticket next Thursday at events in the Mahoning Valley and the Cleveland area, having previously campaigned with Clinton last week in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

The event with Obama comes nearly two weeks later, on Sept. 13 in Philadelphia, urging people in the battleground state to register to vote ahead of the Oct. 11 deadline. Obama previously appeared with Clinton last month in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Both previous dates had been rescheduled after separate shooting incidents. Obama's original June 15 campaign event with Clinton in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was postponed and ultimately relocated weeks later after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. Biden's July 8 event was moved after the shooting of several police officers in Dallas.
