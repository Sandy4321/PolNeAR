What Donald Trump’s Son Just Received In The Mail Instantly Made The FBI Spring Into Action.

The son of billionaire candidate Donald Trump received a threatening letter filled with an unknown white powder on Thursday.

CBS News reports that the letter, postmarked from Massachusetts, was sent to Eric Trump’s apartment at Trump Parc East in New York City, and opened by his wife, Lara.

The letter warned that if Trump did not withdraw from the presidential race, harm would come to his kids. The presidential candidate has five children: Donald Trump, Jr., 38; Ivanka, 34; Eric Trump, 32; Tiffany, 22; and Barron 9.

The Secret Service, the FBI and the New York Police Department are investigating the letter. The white powder contained in it has been sent to a lab for testing, but a preliminary field test indicated it was not hazardous.
