Ben Carson Slams Hillary And The Media In One Debate Answer.

Republican presidential front-runner Ben Carson took an opportunity during Tuesday’s debate to once again address what he considers unfair media scrutiny of his candidacy. Reacting to criticism over perceived autobiographical inconsistencies, the retired neurosurgeon acknowledged that he expected his White House bid to open his past up to investigation.

“I have no problem with being vetted,” he said. “What I do have a problem with is being lied about.”

Carson further lambasted the media’s behavior as evidence of an underlying partisan double standard.

“When I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton,” he said, “who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that [the Benghazi attack] was a terrorist attack and then tells everyone else it was a video, where I come from, they call that a lie.”

He went on to say Clinton’s behavior is “very different from somebody misinterpreting when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point.”

Carson concluded by admonishing journalists who cannot put their personal ideology aside.

“We have to start treating people the same,” he said, “and finding out what people really think and what they’re made of.”
