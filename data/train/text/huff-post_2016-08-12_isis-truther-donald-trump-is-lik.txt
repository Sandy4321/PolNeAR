‘ISIS Truther’ Donald Trump Is Like A Lawyer’s Dumbest Client Ever, Trevor Noah Says.

Now that Donald Trump has ridiculously claimed that the real founder of the Islamic State militant group is President Barack Obama, the GOP nominee had some explaining to do.
“Daily Show” host Trevor Noah on Thursday showed that the businessman was given an opportunity to clarify his remarks with conservative chat host Hugh Hewitt ― and yet Trump tripped again.
“Last night you said the president was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant,” Hewitt said. “You meant that he created the vacuum. He lost the peace.”
Trump replied: “No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS.”
A flabbergasted Noah quipped, “It’s like a lawyer with the dumbest client ever.”
Wait, it gets even more ridiculous. Watch above. (The Trump comments start around the 2:05 mark.)
The routine begins with Noah commenting on how the geopolitical maneuvering between Russia and Turkey could hurt the U.S. in its fight against the Islamic State. But inevitably the bit turns to the circus of Trump. 
Trump did post on Twitter Friday that his claims were “sarcasm” but, boy, that sure took a long time.  
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.
