Wow: Glenn Beck Just Responded To Palin’s Trump Endorsement With One Brutal Line.

Radio talk show host Glenn Beck minced no words Tuesday night in sharing what he thinks of Sarah Palin’s endorsement of Donald Trump.

In a Facebook post after the speech, Beck wrote: “I couldn’t disagree with her more but she has played the game now for years. Perhaps she knows more than those of us still on the outside. Maybe the press was right about her [emphasis added] but for all of the wrong reasons.”

The radioman pointed out that Trump was once an advocate for many of the policies Palin has campaigned against, including “big government, bailouts, executive orders, not just abortion but partial birth abortion, nationalizing of banks, stimulus, pathway to citizenship.”

“What was the massive pivot point to make him change so fundamentally?” Beck questioned.

Beck and the former Alaska governor have had an icy relationship in recent years. Breitbart reports the once-political friends had a falling out after Beck read a private email on his radio program Palin had sent him concerning the 2011 shooting of  Rep. Gabby Giffords.

Last September, Beck called Palin a “clown” on his radio show when commenting on her speech following Donald Trump’s at a Washington D.C. rally to protest the Iran nuclear deal. He apologized the next day, saying it was “childish” to name-call.

The Washington Times reports Beck will endorse Trump rival Sen. Ted Cruz at a rally in Iowa on Saturday.

As the rumors broke Tuesday of the possible Palin endorsement of Trump’s candidacy, Cruz sought to convey that he is taking the news in stride.
