'SNL' has fun with Clinton's struggles.

Hillary Clinton isn’t rattled about the string of losses she’s faced in the Democratic primary — in fact, she said it “humanizes” her.

Of course, this was Clinton’s doppelgänger, Kate McKinnon on "Saturday Night Live" giving the cold open for this weekend’s episode of the show.

“It’s true, I haven’t been winning as of late,” McKinnon says, dressed as Clinton in a bright red pantsuit. “I haven’t won a state in almost three weeks, because that was the plan. I didn’t want to win those, and so I didn’t. It doesn’t bother me one bit. I’m not rattled.”

The "SNL" sketch aired after Bernie Sanders’ win in Wyoming on Saturday. It was the Vermont senator’s eighth win in the last nine contests.

“Who can remember how many states i’ve lost in a row? Is it two? Three?” Clinton asks as a maintenance guy walks in front of her, saying he’s “here to fix the seven holes in your wall.”

The skit also poked fun at Clinton returning to New York to campaign ahead of the state's primary. McKinnon impersonates Clinton's subway gaffe, in which she had trouble using her metro card, trying more than five times to get through the gate before eventually trying to hop the turnstile.
