Report: Walker to speak at Republican National Convention.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month, according to a report Tuesday from WKOW, the ABC affiliate in Madison, Wisconsin.

Walker, who ran for the Republican nomination but dropped out last September, is one of the first speakers to confirm his participation. Donald Trump has said four of his kids and his wife will also speak at the convention.

Beyond that, however, Trump and the RNC have kept the lineup secret. Many prominent Republicans have said they will not attend the convention and others have said they are not interested in speaking.

"The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release," Trump tweeted last Saturday.
