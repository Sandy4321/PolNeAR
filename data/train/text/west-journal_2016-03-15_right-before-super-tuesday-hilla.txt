Right Before ‘Super Tuesday 2’ Hillary Clinton Just Got Some Devastating News.

Fewer than half of the voters surveyed in a new poll released Monday support Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as rival Bernie Sanders continues to pick up support.

In the new Morning Consult poll, conducted March 11-13, 40 percent of likely Democrat voters back Sanders, up four points from a survey a few days earlier. Clinton’s support fell by that same margin down to 48 percent, which is the first time since mid-February that her support level was below 50 percent.

Sanders “is tapping into something that is very deep and very profound inside the Democratic Party, which is this discontent with the system that is no longer producing for everyday people,” Simon Rosenberg, a Clinton supporter, told the New Yorker.

“He has characterized Hillary as a champion of that system and as somebody who is actually a leader of the system, while he is the one that wants to change it. He’s not being perceived as a leftist. He is being perceived as somebody who is deeply in touch with a sense that something has gone wrong and that the system isn’t working.

“Sanders is speaking to a rising generation who want both a better and more responsible capitalism and a better and more ethical politics.”.

“When people respond by the millions to your message, then that message is now mainstream,” Sen. Sanders said recently. “That changes political reality. Smart politicians like Hillary Clinton and anybody else have got to move where the action is, and the action is on those issues that I’ve been raising.”

The Morning Consult poll showed that Donald Trump remained in the lead on the Republican side with 42 percent, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz at 23 percent; Sen. Marco Rubio at 12 percent, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, 9 percent.
