Revealed: What ISIS Propaganda Videos ACTUALLY Contain Makes Hillary’s Trump Claim Even Worse.

ISIS has recently released a propaganda, recruitment video and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will not be happy about who the terrorist group features as the center of hate.

The video that is circulating features two others that could prove embarrassing to the former secretary of state: her husband, former President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.

The video, released in late November, is called No Respite after a passage from Quran verse 71 where it states to carry out a plan “upon me and do not give me respite.” ISIS soldiers mock America’s military tactics in the video and put a pulse on racial tensions in the United States. They state their goal is to expand “califphate” and also address the territorial lines that were drawn in the Sykes-Picot Agreement after World War I.

Clinton is already receiving criticism for her repeated comments in interviews and, most recently, during the ABC Democratic debate. During the debate, Clinton claimed that statements made by Republican front-runner Donald Trump calling for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration makes him “ISIS’ best recruiter.”

“We also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don’t fall on receptive ears,” Clinton said during the debate. “He is becoming ISIS’ best recruiter. They are going to people, showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.”

Politifact deemed those statements false because there is no ISIS recruitment videos targeting the billionaire, only some who suggest that could happen in the future.
