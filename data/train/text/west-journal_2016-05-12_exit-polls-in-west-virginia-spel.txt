Exit Polls In West Virginia Spell Bad News For Hillary Clinton.

If West Virginia is any indication, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is going to be facing major trouble in the general election, especially in coal country.

While it is certainly devastating that she lost the state 36 percent to 51 percent, what is even more stunning is how greatly she is disliked by supporters of her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

In a survey published by NBC News, Democratic voters in West Virginia were asked a series of questions upon leaving the polls Tuesday, and the results are alarming for Clinton.

Not only did she lose to Sanders in almost every demographic, but it seems the public’s view of her, even among her supporters, is awful.

When asked which quality was most important in choosing a candidate, only 23 percent of those who selected someone who “cares about people like me” voted for Clinton, while only 21 percent who chose “honest and trustworthy” cast a vote for her.

Even worse, when given the possibility of their candidate losing, 36 percent of Democrats said they were willing to flip their support to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump; 62 percent of those were Sanders supporters, while 10 percent were supporters of Clinton.

This means that should Clinton become the nominee, she can expect a decent portion of those currently voting for Sanders to defect to Trump.

This sentiment was reflected in another question that asked Democrats how likely Clinton was to defeat Trump in the general election, to which 21 percent said “not too likely” and 14 percent said “not at all likely.” Roughly two-thirds of those who picked these options were supporters of Sanders.
