"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) took the stage in Iowa late Monday night trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by just 0.3 percentage points in the Democratic presidential caucus, so it was fitting that his speech resembled a version he would give for a victory more than one for a loss.
“While the results are not yet known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie,” Sanders said.
Sanders said he just barely trailed Clinton with 94 percent of precincts reporting. Clinton had 49.9 percent to Sanders’ 49.6 percent. (See the latest results here.)"
