Clinton Campaign Manager Laughs, Evades Reporter’s Question.

With the upcoming presidential race set to go full tilt, questions are beginning to surface as to when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will hold her next press conference.

When Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager was asked during a luncheon held by The Wall Street Journal if Clinton would schedule a press conference prior to Election Day, he laughed and said, “We’ll see.”

The Washington Post reports Clinton’s last press conference was held on Dec. 4.

Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan, in an attempt to draw attention to Clinton’s lack of press conferences, wrote, “The candidate, famously opaque, answered a grand total of seven questions [in Iowa] on Dec. 4, 2015. Since then, although she’s given individual interviews, she hasn’t made herself available for general media questioning.”

Clinton has responded to inquiries into her lack of press conferences by drawing attention to the one-on-one interviews she has granted, along with answering general questions from the media.

Ruth Marcus, editorial board editor for The Washington Post, asked Mook if a Clinton administration would continue to decline press conferences.

Mook refused to speculate on the events following the election, adding that he would be on vacation at that time.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has blasted the media for allowing Clinton to go so long without a press conference.

While he was speaking with the press in Miami on Wednesday, he said, “It’s been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference and you as reporters who give her all these glowing reports should ask yourselves why. I’ll tell you why: Despite the nice platitudes, she’s been a mess.”

Trump went on to criticize the Democratic National Convention for its failure to mention ISIS or the plight of police officers in the U.S.
