Clinton’s Poll Numbers Jump Post-Democratic Convention.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has bounced back in the polls and is now leading Republican Donald Trump by an even greater margin in the wake of the Democratic National Convention, according to a new nationwide poll.

Clinton, who was tied with Trump at 42 percent on July 25, is now well ahead of the GOP challenger 46 percent to 39 percent according to a CBS poll released Monday. The new poll has a margin of error of three percentage points. The size of Clinton’s post-convention bounce appears likely to be larger than the three to four percentage points enjoyed by Trump after the Republican convention.

In the poll, Clinton’s support has steadily risen over the past two weeks, going from 40 percent on July 14 to 46 percent on August 1. Trump, on the other hand, rose from 40 percent on July 14 to 42 percent following the GOP convention before slipping back to 39 percent in Monday’s poll.

The poll showed that Clinton remains the leader among female voters while Trump leads among men. Clinton leads among higher-educated Americans while Trump is the leader among white Americans without a college degree.

The poll also noted that 73 percent of Democrats who said they had supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., now support Clinton. Last month, she was at 67 percent support among Sanders supporters.

The CBS poll gave Clinton a much higher lead that other polls. A Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Clinton leading by 2.2 percent over Trump. However, the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Daybreak national tracking poll shows Trump with a four-point lead, with 46.2 percent to Clinton’s 42.1 percent.
