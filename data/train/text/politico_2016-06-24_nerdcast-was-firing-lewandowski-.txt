2016 Nerdcast: Was firing Lewandowski the start of Trump’s reset?

It's time for Episode 7 of the 2016 Nerdcast, POLITICO's new podcast on the race for the White House.

In this week’s episode, editor and guest host Susan Glasser, chief investigative reporter Ken Vogel, senior correspondent Eli Stokols, senior politics editor Charlie Mahtesian and campaigns editor Scott Bland take you behind the scenes of the Corey Lewandowski dismissal: Find out who really fired him, how things went down, and if the growing influence of Trump's children will save his campaign. Plus: what Hillary Clinton’s staggering money advantage means for 2016 and the control of the Senate.
