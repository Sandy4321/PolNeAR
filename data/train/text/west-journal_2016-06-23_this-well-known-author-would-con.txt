This Well-Known Author Would Consider Third-Party Presidential Run IF….

It’s no secret that die-hard conservatives don’t really like Donald Trump.

Conservative Christians were upset he admittedly has never asked God to forgive him for anything. Constitutionalists, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, consider him a phony. And even many conservative patriots, like both of the Bush presidents, aren’t planning on voting for the billionaire turned Republican presidential candidate.

The displeasure in the presumptive Republican nominee has caused many to wonder if a more conservative third-party candidate should run.

Best-selling thriller writer Brad Thor told TheBlaze founder Glenn Beck he would consider running as a third-party candidate if he could earn 15 percent of the vote in the polls.

Thor and Beck often meet together. Just a few weeks ago, as Western Journalism reported, Thor and Beck were discussing a hypothetical situation wherein the assassination of Trump might have to be carried out. The mere mention of the assassination theory prompted Sirius XM to suspend Beck from its airwaves for a week.

Nonetheless, the two are on air again, now tossing around the idea of a Thor candidacy.

The notion started when Thor expressed an interest in debating Trump. Beck reminded Thor he’d have to earn 15 percent in the polls in order to be able to get to debate the billionaire. Thor countered if he was able to get 15 percent in the polls he’d simply go on to run as a third-party candidate.

“Imagine Brad Thor going up against Trump and Clinton on the same stage,” mused Blaze co-host Stu Burguiere. “Not to mention, President Thor. We are the biggest badasses ever.”
