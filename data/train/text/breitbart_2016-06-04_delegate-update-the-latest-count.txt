Delegate Update: The latest count in the Democratic race.

It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination for president. A look at where the race for those delegates stands, based on an Associated Press count, heading into the Virgin Islands’ caucuses Saturday in which seven delegates are at stake:

___.
