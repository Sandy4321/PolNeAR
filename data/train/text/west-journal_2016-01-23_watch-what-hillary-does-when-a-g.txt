WATCH What Hillary Does When A Guy Walks Up And Confronts Her With 1 Question She Hates.

20266The question was about transparency. The tactic used instead of an answer was pretty transparent as well.

After a New Hampshire rally Friday, Hillary Clinton was asked about speeches she made behind closed doors to a group of Goldman Sachs employees in 2014. Politico reported, according to sources in the meetings, Clinton tried to calm any jitters among the financial firm’s leaders by telling them she was not going to crusade against past wrongs by Wall Street financiers.

Nothing was ever released officially. Lee Wang of The Intercept asked Clinton Friday whether she would release transcripts.

Melissa Cronin of Gawker then describes what happens on a video of the encounter.

“Clinton 1) registers the meaning of Fang’s words, 2) realizes their implications, 3) lets loose a steady stream of he-he-he’s and, finally, 4) deftly averts her gaze—all with a warm, unwavering smile pasted across her face,” Cronin wrote.

New Hampshire Public Radio asked Clinton Friday how the “average person should view the hefty speaking fees?”

“I spoke to a wide array of groups who wanted to hear what I thought about the world coming off of my time as secretary of state,” said Clinton. “I happen to think we need more conversation about what’s going on in the world.

“I think groups that want to talk and ask questions and hear about that are actually trying to educate themselves because we’re living in a really complicated world.”
