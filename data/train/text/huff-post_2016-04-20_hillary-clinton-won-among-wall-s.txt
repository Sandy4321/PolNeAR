Hillary Clinton Won Among Wall Street-Friendly Voters In New York.

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton performed well among New York primary voters who believe that Wall Street is a boon for the economy, according to exit polling data.
More than 6 in 10 New York Democratic voters said that Wall Street does more to hurt the economy than help, according to preliminary exit polling reported by CNN and The New York Times.
Clinton won by almost 60 points among the 30 percent of voters who said Wall Street does more to help the economy.
These figures are relatively unsurprising, as Democratic opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has criticized Clinton for having ties to Wall Street.
The former secretary of state earned more than $11 million delivering 51 speeches in 2014 and the first three months of 2015, according to The Washington Post. Her three speeches to employees of investment bank Goldman Sachs earned her a total of $675,000, and are causing a particular uproar. Sanders has accused Clinton of being influenced by special interest groups.
Clinton has been asked to release the transcripts of these speeches.
“Let everybody who’s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them. We’ll all release them at the same time,” she told ABC News in February. “I have never, ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of funding.”
Clinton’s victory in Tuesday’s New York primary was also achieved through the support of women (61 percent), nonwhite voters (67 percent) and Democrats looking for an experienced candidate (90 percent), according to CNN.
