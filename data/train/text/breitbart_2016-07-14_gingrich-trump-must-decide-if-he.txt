Gingrich: Trump Must Decide If He Wants a Two-Pirate Ticket.

Wednesday on Fox New Channel’s “Hannity,” Newt Gingrich said if presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump picked him it as a vice presidential running mate it would be a “two-pirate ticket.”

Gingrich said, “In many ways, Donald Trump is like a pirate. He’s outside the normal system. He gets things done. He’s bold. He’s actually like a figure out of a movie. In a lot of ways, my entire career has been a little bit like a pirate. I’ve taken on the establishment of both parties. I’ve been very prepared to fight in the media. One of the really hard questions he’s got to weigh on the way to California is, do you really want a two-pirate ticket?”
