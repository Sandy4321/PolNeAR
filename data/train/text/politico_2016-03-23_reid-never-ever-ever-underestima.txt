Reid: 'Never, ever, ever underestimate Trump.'

Harry Reid has some advice for Democrats already celebrating Hillary Clinton as the next president: Don’t underestimate Donald Trump.

While Democratic groups and the party committees circulate all the reasons that Trump could doom the Republicans’ bid for the White House as well as their congressional majorities, Republicans are now positing that Trump could bring disenchanted voters back to the GOP to help them compete in the Rust Belt.

Asked about Trump reshaping the map, Reid said the party should brace for how unpredictable this election could be with Trump on the ballot.

"Never, ever, ever underestimate Trump. No one should do that. I tried, others have tried. He's a hard guy to predict,” Reid said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “One of the most unorthodox candidates for the presidency in modern times. Certainly in modern times, post-modern times. A real unusual deal we have here."

Still, Reid would not say whether he would prefer that Democrats face Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The minority leader said flatly: “I don’t think it matters.”

"You have one who has been plotting to be president for six or seven months. That's Trump. You have Cruz, who has been plotting to be president since he was in elementary school,” Reid said.

With mixed results on Tuesday night in the presidential race, the Nevada Democrat’s biggest takeaway is a belief that the GOP doesn’t want people voting. He predicted lawsuits could be filed in reaction to the long waits at the Arizona primary locations.

“In Arizona last night they just arbitrarily reduced the polling places,” Reid said. “There could be some litigation in that regard. The Arizona race showed me how desperate the Republicans are to do anything they can to suppress turnout.”
