DNC chair dismisses Sanders' accusations against Clinton's fundraising.

Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz dismissed Bernie Sanders’ accusations that the Clinton campaign is violating federal election law through its joint fundraising agreement with the DNC — saying the Sanders campaign chose not to accept the same help.

“Both candidates have a joint fundraising agreement that is exactly like the joint fundraising agreements that we’ve had with our previous candidates for president,” Wasserman Schultz said in an interview with FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo this morning. “There is absolutely nothing different in the way that we have spent money and raised money with Secretary Clinton.”

Her comments are in response to a letter the Sanders campaign sent the DNC on Monday alleging that Clinton’s fundraising arrangement was inappropriate. The joint account, Hillary’s Victory Fund, includes the Clinton campaign, 32 state Democratic committees and the DNC. She has raised $33 million through that account, according to a recent Federal Elections Commission report.

The Clinton campaign denies any wrongdoing and points out that Sanders signed the same joint fundraising agreement, though it hasn’t used it in the same way.

“Senator Sanders has chosen not to exercise the use of his joint fundraising agreement, but we have absolutely no violations and we are running the joint victory fund with the Clinton campaign exactly according to the way we are supposed to,” Wasserman Schultz said.
