convention notebook.

Another first.

Hillary Clinton isn't the only person breaking barriers in Philadelphia.

When Sarah McBride took the stage Thursday, she became the first openly transgender person to speak at a major party's convention, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports.

The Democratic platform explicitly recognizes transgender people, outlining several areas in which the party would like to see their circumstances improve.

"Today in America, LGBTQ people are targeted by hate that lives in both laws and hearts. Many still struggle just to get by. But I believe tomorrow can be different. Tomorrow, we can be respected and protected - especially if Hillary Clinton is our president. And that's why I'm proud to say that I'm with her," McBride said.

Lawbreaker?

Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters that Donald Trump "may have violated the law" by calling on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton to find a trove of deleted emails.

Reid was among friends with the Nevada delegation in Philadelphia Wednesday morning.

And he made the suggestion that Trump should receive only false information in his intelligence briefings, which he is entitled to as the GOP nominee for president.

"He can have intelligence briefings," Reid said. "But I hope they are fake."
