Saudi prince mocks Trump on Twitter.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal mocked Donald Trump's retweet of a digitally manipulated image of himself and his sister posing with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.

"Trump:You base your statements on photoshopped pics?I bailed you out twice;a 3rd time,maybe?" tweeted Prince Alwaleed, the nephew of the late King Abdullah and fellow real estate investor, on Thursday, hours after Trump retweeted the image in question.

Alwaleed's tweet linked to screenshots and links of three news articles from Business Insider, BuzzFeed News and Yahoo News, in which the prince's involvement of purchases of Trump's property was documented.

In December, the prince called for Trump to drop out of the race, calling him "a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America."

Trump responded to that tweet by calling Alwaleed "dopey" and accusing him of wanting to control the U.S. politicians "with daddy's money."
