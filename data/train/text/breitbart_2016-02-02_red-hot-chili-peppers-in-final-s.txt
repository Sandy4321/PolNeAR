Red Hot Chili Peppers in final stages of new album, announce #FeelTheBern benefit concert.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2 (UPI) — The next Red Hot Chili Peppers record is almost complete, frontman Anthony Kiedis recently revealed.

Speaking on radio show Joney’s Jukebox last week, Kiedis said his band and collaborator Brian Burton, AKA Danger Mouse, wrote a host of new songs for the upcoming album.

“We had written two dozen songs before we got with [Danger Mouse],” Kiedis said, mentioning the long-awaited album is “in the home stretch.”

“[He] is like, ‘Let’s keep a few of those, but let’s go write all new songs in the studio,’ We’re looking at each other like, ‘Dude, we kind of already wrote the songs, bro,’” Keidis continued. “He’s like, ‘No, I like to write new ones in the studio.’ So, in honor of accommodating this new process, we wrote all new songs, and it’s a good thing we did.”

News of the soon-to-be complete album spreads just as Red Hot Chili Peppers announced a benefit concert in support of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

Band member Flea shared the news on social media last week, writing “Feels great to support someone I believe in. The Rhcp offered to give him the money to pay for the theater that night but he wouldn’t accept, he only accepts small donations from individuals…This is a man with integrity.”

The concert will take place in Los Angeles on Feb. 5, just a handful of days after Sanders was announced the second-place winner of the Iowa Caucus behind Hillary Clinton.
