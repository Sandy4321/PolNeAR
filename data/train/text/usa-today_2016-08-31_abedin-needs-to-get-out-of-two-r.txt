Abedin needs to get out of two relationships.

LETTERS.

Hillary Clinton should cut ties with long time aide Huma Abedin, as she has become a major liability.

It is obvious that Abedin learned a lot about poor judgment from Clinton. She married a loser like former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, who is just a sex-crazed man infatuated with his own physique and exposing it on social media.

Abedin has also played a supporting role in the private email and Clinton Foundation controversies of late.

Though she has served Clinton well over the years, she has become too much of a distraction in her presidential campaign.

It's been reported that former congressman Anthony Weiner has been sexting again, which prompted wife Huma Abedin to ask for a separation.

Most people who get themselves into the mess he did the first time would learn their lesson. Not Weiner; he keeps on doing what he was doing before. If Abedin didn't divorce him the first time, then she won't now either. Guess she's been to the Hillary Clinton's school of standing-by-your-man despite the fact that he's a lech.

If Weiner had a drinking or gambling problem, I guess the results would be the same inane comments. A little sympathy is  needed for a man who is so self destructive. Hopefully, he will seek help.

So Weiner's wife is out campaigning with the wife of a man who has had affairs himself. Ah yes, what a great pair of feminisists these two are.

Why was Weiner so convinced that random women, who didn't know him, wanted to see his genitals? And how could he keep falling for the same prank from women over and over again?
