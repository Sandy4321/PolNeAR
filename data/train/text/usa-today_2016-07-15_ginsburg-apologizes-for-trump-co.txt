Ginsburg apologizes for Trump comments; 
Justice vows to be 'more circumspect' with her opinions.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg regrets her insults of Donald Trump.

The Supreme Court justice -- who has been involved in a scuffle with the presumptive Republican nominee over the past few days -- said she regretted her remarks and promised to stay out of it in the future.

"On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised, and I regret making them," Ginsburg said in a statement. "Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future, I will be more circumspect."

In three separate interviews, the justice sounded off on Trump, saying she didn't "want to contemplate" the effects a Trump candidacy would have on the court.

Ginsburg is known for her liberal bent, but the comments created a firestorm because members of the Supreme Court generally avoid getting involved in presidential politics.

Trump called on her to resign from her post and said, "Her mind is shot!"

He wasn't the only one unhappy with the remarks: Ginsburg received widespread (and bipartisan) criticism, even earning editorials from The New York Times and The Washington Post.
