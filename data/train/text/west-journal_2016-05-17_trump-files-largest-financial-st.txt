Trump Files Largest Financial Statement In FEC History.

Presidential candidate Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he filed his required financial statement with the Federal Elections Commission, saying it set a new benchmark for the agency.

“I filed my PFD (Personal Financial Disclosure), which I am proud to say is the largest in the history of the FEC,” Trump said in a press release. The candidate claims his net worth is in excess of $10 billion.

“Despite the fact that I am allowed extensions, I have again filed my report, which is 104 pages, on time,” he added, noting that Sen. Bernie Sanders requested an extension.

“This is the difference between a businessman and the all-talk, no-action politicians that have failed the American people for far too long,” said Trump.

But as The Hill pointed out, “Still, Trump has so far declined to release any tax returns, something every major party nominee has done in the modern era. Tax returns are more detailed than the PFDs and include information not on the disclosure form.”

Trump’s new PFD form stated that his revenue increased from $362 million in 2014 to $557 million in 2015, an increase of almost $200 million.

The figure does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rent or royalties, according to The Hill.

“This income was utilized, among other things, for the funding of construction projects at various multimillion-dollar developments, reduction of debt and the funding of the campaign,” the Trump campaign explained in its release.

Trump estimates that he spent between $45 million and $50 million to date for his presidential campaign, supplemented by contributions from supporters.
