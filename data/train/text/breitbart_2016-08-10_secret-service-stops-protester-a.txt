Secret Service stops protester at Hillary Clinton rally.

DES MOINES, Iowa, Aug. 10 (UPI) — Hillary Clinton on Wednesday had her second run in with an animal rights protester in a week when Secret Service had to surround her after a woman broke through a barricade and made a run for the stage in Iowa.

The Democratic nominee for president never stopped speaking at a Des Moines rally as Secret Service members stood around her on stage and others tackled and carried away the protester.

Kelsey Atkinson was identified as the protester, wearing a shirt that read “Animal liberation now.” She’s a member of the animal rights organization Direct Action Everywhere, which also tried to interrupt a Clinton rally last Thursday in Las Vegas.

The incident comes just a day after controversial remarks by her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, were interpreted by some as a threat of violence against her.

“By the way, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Trump told a North Carolina rally, saying Clinton would “abolish the second amendment.”

“Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don’t know. But — but I’ll tell you what. That will be a horrible day.”

Multiple outlets reported on Wednesday the Secret Service had “more than one conversation” with Trump or his staff about the statement.

Clinton seemed to be ready to riff on the incident in Iowa, telling the crowd, “Some people get a little carried away, have you noticed that?”
