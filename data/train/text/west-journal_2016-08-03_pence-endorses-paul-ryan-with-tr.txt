Pence Endorses Paul Ryan With Trump’s Blessing.

While Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has yet to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan’s re-election bid, Trump’s running mate — Indiana Gov. Mike Pence — has thrown his support behind Ryan.

And he claims his boss is OK with it.

On Monday, Trump refused to endorse Ryan, in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat play on words, the same wording Paul Ryan used in may when he was first asked if he would support Trump as the Republican nominee.

Trump told the Washington Post, “I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country. We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I’m just not quite there yet. I’m not quite there yet.”

When Trump used the words, “I’m not quite there yet,” he was echoing Ryan, who used the same words when asked in May if he would endorse Trump. The snub at endorsing Trump led to a sit-down meeting with Ryan, where the two appeared to hash out their differences, but Ryan has been very vocal in rejecting several of Trump’s comments throughout the campaign as not being representative of the Republican Party.

Pence, on the other hand, had no trouble breaking with his potential future boss in endorsing Ryan.

In a telephone interview with Fox News’ Jenna Lee, Pence was asked about the “not there yet” comment. Pence replied, “These are two men that are building a good will relationship.”

Pence went on to say he’s “confident” that once the elections are over, “these two men are going to do great things, at home and abroad.”

Pence said in politics it takes time to develop those relationships but added, “I strongly support Paul Ryan, strongly endorse his re-election…we need Paul Ryan…to make America great again,” Pence said.

Trump’s potential VP then revealed Trump, “strongly encouraged me to endorse Paul Ryan, and I’m pleased to do it.”
