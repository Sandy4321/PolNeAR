Paul Ryan: FBI Decision Not to Indict Hillary ‘Defies Explanation,’ Needs More Investigation.

Republican U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan blasted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Tuesday for its inexplicable decision not to indict Hillary Clinton.

FBI director James Comey decided not to recommend indicting Clinton at a press conference Tuesday even though he found “evidence” that Clinton potentially violated classified information laws.

Ryan said that “we need more information” about how the FBI came to its bizarre conclusion Tuesday. But Ryan’s language in the statement makes clear that he is being polite and showing “respect” to the FBI, and that he seems to feel the case will be litigated at the ballot box at this point, not by prosecutors.
