Dinesh D’Souza Just Made HUGE Prediction About 2016 Presidency – It’s The LAST Thing Some Will Want To hear.

Filmmaker and best-selling author Dinesh D’Souza made his prediction who the next president will be, and the GOP will not be happy.

After BlazeTV’s Glenn Beck asked the conservative who he thought would win the presidency, D’Souza replied, “If I had to bet now, I regret to say, I would bet on Hillary.”

“We should never confuse who we want to win, with who is going to win,” he added. “You asked who is going to be. I think Hillary is going to be, because their game is really good. They fight like it matters to them. They are in a knife fight, not a chess match. We have to up our game.”

D’Souza went on to explain that the Clintons’ and other liberals’ commitment to obtaining and retaining power is unrelenting. “I respect their ruthlessness. If you look at Hillary, here political strategy is to doggedly move ahead and dare everyone to bludgeon her to the ground and sit on her, otherwise, she is going to keep moving, you got to respect that,” he said.

D’Souza told Beck that he is making a movie set to be released in the summer that chronicles the “secret history” of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.

The conservative released 2016: Obama’s America in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. In the film, D’Souza argues that Obama’s early influences from radical figures like communist Frank Marshall Davis shaped his views concerning the United States and its place in the world. The documentarian lays out what he believes are the president’s core beliefs, which he posits make it fairly easy to predict Obama’s future actions.

The film became the second highest grossing political documentary at the box office, behind Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11.
