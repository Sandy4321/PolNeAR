British diplomat praises Obama's presidency.

President Barack Obama has an admirer in British diplomat Sir Peter Westmacott.

Westmacott, who will retire soon after also serving in Iran, Turkey and France, praised Obama’s presidency in an interview published Saturday. He currently serves as the British ambassador to the U.S.

“I think the legacy, the balance sheet, doesn’t look bad,” he told the Guardian. “It certainly doesn’t feel to me like this is a lame-duck presidency which has given up. He’s motoring along and he’s doing through executive action what he needs to."

The comments come as Westmacott readies to leave his post and Obama heads into the final year of his presidency.

Westmacott also said that Obama shows “great charm” and exhibits a fondness for the United Kingdom.

“President Obama seems to me to be somebody who’s pretty fond of the UK and never misses an opportunity to tell us how enthusiastic he is and the affection he feels toward the royal family, for example,” he said.

The diplomat also mused about the 2016 race, pushing back against candidates — like Republican front-runner Donald Trump — who say the country is in decline.

“I don’t think this is a country which is in decline at all,” Westmacott said. “This is still the most prosperous and successful country in the world, the biggest economy. It is still the leader of the free world; I don’t see that changing any time soon.”

Regarding the Democratic front-runner, Westmacott said Hillary Clinton and Obama “did a remarkable job of making America loved again after the difficult years of the previous regime."
