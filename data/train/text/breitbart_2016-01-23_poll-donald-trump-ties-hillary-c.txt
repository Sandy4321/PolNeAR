Poll: Donald Trump Ties Hillary Clinton With Michael Bloomberg in a Three-Way Contest.

GOP frontrunner Donald Trump does better in a match up against Hillary Clinton or Michael Bloomberg than fellow GOP presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), according to a new poll.

With former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly considering a presidential run as an Independent, a Morning Consult Poll found that he would draw from Clintonâ€™s support in a three-candidate matchup among Bloomberg, Clinton and Trump.

Trump received 37 percent, Clinton had 36 percent and Bloomberg snagged 13 percent, according to the results.

However, Clinton wins in the three-candidate match ups when Cruz and Rubio replace Trump.

Between Clinton, Cruz and Bloomberg, Clinton wins with 38 percent support; Cruz comes in second with 34 percent while Bloomberg receives 11 percent.

According to the results, Clinton increases her lead by one point in a match up with Rubio and Bloomberg.

Clinton received 38 percent, while Rubio held 33 percent and Bloomberg had 10 percent.

The poll collected data online from 4,060 registered voters with a two percent plus or minus margin of error.
