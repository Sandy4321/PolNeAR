Clinton: Time for ‘intensification’ of ISIL strategy.

Hillary Clinton says the Obama administration should be taking additional measures against the Islamic State and that she expects President Barack Obama to announce an “intensification” in the U.S. campaign.

“We’re not winning, but it’s too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do,” Clinton said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “I think that’s what we’ll hear from the president, an intensification of the existing strategy. And I think there’s some additional steps we have to take.”

The Democratic presidential front-runner and former secretary of state said the U.S. “clearly” needed a more robust air campaign against the Islamic State targeting the militant group’s leaders and its oil infrastructure.

“I think you’ll hear that from the president,” she said. “And part of what I have been arguing, for quite some time now, is that we’ve got to do a better job of getting back the Sunnis on the ground, along with the Kurds, who can be the fighters who will actually take back territory with air cover and with targeted attacks on ISIS infrastructure.”

Clinton reiterated that she did not want U.S. combat troops on the ground to fight the Islamic State, aside from special operations forces and advisers.

“Where I sit right now, I think it would make things worse, not better,” Clinton said, while arguing the U.S. should increase its special operations forces against ISIL.

Clinton also focused on the need to combat the Islamic State on the Internet, pushing for help from the private sector to push back against the group’s robust propaganda machine. “We’re going to need help from Facebook and from YouTube and from Twitter,” she said.

She declined to weigh in, however, on the debate over Internet encryption and terrorism, only saying that she hoped that the private sector and law enforcement could come together and find a solution.
