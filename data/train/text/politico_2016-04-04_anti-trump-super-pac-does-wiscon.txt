Anti-Trump super PAC does Wisconsin robocall.

On the eve of the critical Wisconsin primary, an anti-Donald Trump super PAC is releasing a robocall spotlighting a home-state congressman who’s turned the New York businessman into a punching bag.

In the call, Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble, who was elected in the conservative wave of 2010, casts Trump as a former liberal who would “unravel” the policies he and fellow congressional Republicans have pushed for. He specifically points to Trump’s expressions of support for government-funded health care and his past opposition to a ban on partial birth abortion.

“Time again, he's shown us he takes his positions out of convenience and not conviction,” Ribble says in the call. “Before you vote, ask yourself: Can we really trust Donald Trump to fight for us?”

The call is being paid for by Our Principles PAC, a group that is devoted to defeating Trump. It is being sent to households in northeastern Wisconsin, the area that Ribble, who is retiring at the end of his current term, represents.

The super PAC has spent over $2 million targeting the real estate mogul in Wisconsin, a state seen as critical for the Stop Trump movement. Polls there show Trump is trailing Ted Cruz just ahead of Tuesday's vote.
