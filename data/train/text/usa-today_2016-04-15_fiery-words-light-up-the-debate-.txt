Fiery words light up The debate stage in N.Y.; 
Sanders, Clinton exchange shots as crucial contest nears.

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton stood face-to-face Thursday and repeated the attacks they have been airing in the media since their last debate a month ago.

Sanders started out their ninth debate saying "of course" Clinton has the qualifications to be president -- having suggested in a recent speech that she is unqualified -- but said he questioned her judgment based on her vote in favor of the Iraq war and her decision to allow a super PAC to support her campaign.

Clinton fired back that the "people of New York voted for me twice" for the U.S. Senate, so clearly believed in her judgment. She added that Sanders' widely criticized April 1 interview with the editorial board of the New York Daily News -- in which he struggled to provide detailed explanations of key policies -- raised questions about his judgment.

When Sanders accused Clinton of being too reliant on Wall Street, she said "I stood up against the behavior of the banks" for reckless financial transactions. Sanders shot back, "Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by that."

Clinton, pressed by moderator Dana Bash to release transcripts of her private speeches, turned the issue instead to Sanders' failure to release his tax returns. Sanders said he would release his 2014 return Friday, and others shortly thereafter.

Clinton repeatedly invoked President Obama and suggested that Sanders' critiques of her amounted to attacks on Obama. In response to Sanders' charge that she has been weak on climate change, she said she and Obama had made progress in the face of GOP opposition. "I really believe that the president has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported."

The campaign for the Democratic nomination -- tame compared with the battle on the Republican side -- has turned increasingly nasty ahead of New York's delegate-rich Tuesday primary.

Much is at stake in New York. It has the second-highest number of pledged delegates, 247, next to California.

An average of recent polls by RealClearPolitics shows Clinton leads Sanders by about 13 points in the state, where both candidates claim ties. Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn. Clinton moved there in 2000 and represented the state in the Senate for eight years.

In an unusual bit of scheduling, after the debate Sanders was to fly to the Vatican for a conference on social, economic and environmental issues. He is scheduled to make a short speech there but is not expected to meet Pope Francis.

Clinton is  heading to California for a campaign swing, including  fundraising events with actor George Clooney.
