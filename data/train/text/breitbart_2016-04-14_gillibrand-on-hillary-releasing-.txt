Gillibrand on Hillary Releasing Her Goldman Sachs Speech Transcripts: ‘I Think She Will.’

Friday on CNN’s “New Day,” Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid for the presidency told host Chris Cuomo she believed that Clinton would inevitably release a transcript of a speech she had given to Goldman Sachs.

“I think she will,” Gillibrand replied. “I think she’s been clear that she’s going to. Yes, I would. I post my taxes online. I was one of the first senators to do that. I like transparency and accountability. I know Hillary does as well. She wants to bring accountability into government, particularly on foreign policy and national security. I think last night you saw she was very, very lucid who we can create stability in the Middle East as well as how do we keep America safe. I think she cares about openness and transparency. And I think she will release them at the appropriate time.”
