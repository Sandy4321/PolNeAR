Hillary Camp Declining To Debate Bernie – What ever Happened To Debating “Anytime, Anywhere.”

Video Transcript:

A few weeks ahead of the New York Primary, Hillary Clinton’s campaign says they are unwilling to debate.

KATE BOULDUAN: Why not debate?

JOEL BENENSON: This is a man who said he’d never run a negative ad, ever. He’s now running them. They’re now planning to run more. Let’s see the tone of the campaign he wants to run before we get to any other questions.

BOULDUAN: You guys, back in January, when there was this whole back and forth about debates, the Clinton campaign was open to more debates after the Flint debate was agreed to. Why not debate in New York?

BENENSON: Senator Sanders doesn’t get to decide when we debate. Particularly when he’s running a very negative campaign against us. Let’s see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on. If he does that, then we’ll talk about debates.

The ads are too tough huh? What ever happened to Hillary’s mantra of always being willing?

CLINTON: Honestly, I mean, I just believe that this is the most important job in the world. It’s the toughest job in the world. You should be willing to campaign for every vote. You should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere.
