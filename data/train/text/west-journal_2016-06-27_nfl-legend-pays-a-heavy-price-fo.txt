NFL Legend Pays A Heavy Price For Supporting Donald Trump.

Not everyone is on the Trump train. Just ask former NFL star Herschel Walker.

The former Heisman Trophy winner, now a guest speaker who travels around the country, endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2015.

Walker now says he is being denied the opportunity to appear at some venues due to his open support for Trump.

In an interview with TMZ Sports, Walker said, “I’ve had a lot of people cancel speech engagements with me because of my relationship with Donald.”

Their relationship began in 1984, when Trump signed Walker to a rich contract when he was owner of the New Jersey Generals of the USFL. Walker also appeared on Trump’s Celebrity Apprentice. The NFL legend said people misunderstand Trump.

“I’ve known Donald before he became ‘The Donald.’ Donald is not a racist. … Just because you build a wall doesn’t mean you’re racist,” Walker said.

Playing Field Promotions, a sports and celebrity talent agency, says that Walker, who charges somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 for speaking fees, has lost close to $100,000 simply for being a Trump fan.

“We have to do what’s right to save America. … I guarantee you [Donald] would do better than a lot of people in office now. That I can tell you for a fact,” Walker told TMZ Sports.

Clearly money is not the priority for Walker as he will continue to back the billionaire entrepreneur.
