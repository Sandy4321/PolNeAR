Canada’s Cape Breton Will Welcome American Refugees Fleeing President Trump.

Each election cycle, there’s a threat many people make but few keep: “If so-and-so wins, I’m moving to Canada!”

Now, one kind-hearted Canadian wants to help Americans keep that promise should Donald Trump win the presidency.

Rob Calabrese, a radio host in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, has set up a website called “Cape Breton If Donald Trump Wins“ that pitches the island as a new home for anyone seeking refuge.

“Hi Americans! Donald Trump may become the President of your country!” a welcome message on the website reads. “If that happens, and you decide to get the hell out of there, might I suggest moving to Cape Breton Island!”

Calabrese told the National Post he’s already received hundreds of emails from Americans interested in moving to the island.

“I’m in disbelief,” he said. “I wish everyone from Cape Breton could read them because they really make you proud of living here.”

“Don’t wait until Donald Trump is elected president to find somewhere else to live! Start now, that way, on election day, you just hop on a bus to start your new life in Cape Breton, where women can get abortions, Muslim people can roam freely, and the only ‘walls’ are holding up the roofs of our extremely affordable houses.”

Calabrese is also honest about some of the challenges the island is facing, including the very reason he hopes Americans and others consider moving there: high unemployment and a declining population.

“A slow economy, in combination with out-migration has us on an unsustainable path,” the website explains. “The truth is we welcome all, no matter the ideology. We have a beautiful island, a friendly people, a rich culture and a bright future. Join us here on Cape Breton Island!”

For those interested, the website has some links on how to get started.
