LOOK: Shocking Photos Of GOP Candidate’s Rally Are Going Viral- It’s Not What You Think….

Marco Rubio is raising eyebrows all across the country by staying in the GOP race for president long even though it appears he has little chance of winning the nomination.

And now, just days away from the primary in his home state of Florida, a series of photos from his most recent rally is revealing a shocking truth Rubio should probably heed.

Rubio rolled into Hialeah, Fla., for a planned rally held at a local high school football stadium on Wednesday. Being that this is his own backyard, one might think the senator would fill the stadium with supporters excited to see him.

But as a Politico reporter noted, he didn’t even fill the place to the 20-yard line:

CNN also noted the relatively sparse attendance:

Even right-leaning journalist Byron York took a moment to point out the lack of a crowd at Rubio’s event.

Still, one has to feel bad for the tough job Rubio staffers have maintaining their enthusiasm level. Rubio press secretary Brooke Sammon gave it the old college try, though, tweeting the following:

It’s amazing what a different camera angle can do for the narrative, isn’t it?

Virtually all analysts say that if Rubio can’t win his home state, his campaign for president is over. Recent polling is showing Trump has a significant lead over Rubio in Florida.

Even an anti-Trump PAC recently revealed its polling shows Trump crushing Rubio in the Sunshine State.

According to the Real Clear Politics average, Trump is up 15.6 points in Florida.

In fact, Ted Cruz thinks Rubio’s status in Florida is so weak that he jumped into Florida with both feet this week, sensing he just might be able to take second place away from Rubio. Cruz made a show of opening 10 new campaign offices in Florida to take advantage of Rubio’s falling poll numbers.

Florida Republicans will have a chance to make their voice known on Tuesday.
