Bernie Sanders To Release Medical Records After Pressure From Clinton Ally.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he will make his medical health records available to the public, as is tradition for those seeking the presidency.

“Of course we’re going to release our medical records,” Sanders said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “Thank God, I am very healthy. We will get medical records out the same way that Secretary [Hillary] Clinton has gotten her records out. It is not a problem.”

Politico reported Saturday that David Brock, founder of Correct the Record — a pro-Clinton super PAC — was planning to call on the senator to release his records before the Iowa caucuses. Clinton released her medical records in July, which showed she was fit for duty.

The report prompted a rare public reprimand from the chair of Clinton’s campaign.

Last month, The Huffington Post’s Scott Conroy asked Sanders whether questions about his health and age were fair game in the campaign.

“Sure it is. I would not have run if I was not blessed, and I’m very, very thankful — I cannot remember the last day I took off because of illness,” he said.

The 74-year-old underwent outpatient hernia repair surgery in November.
