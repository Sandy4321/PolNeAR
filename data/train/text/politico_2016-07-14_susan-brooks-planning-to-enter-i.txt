Susan Brooks planning to enter Indiana governor contest.

Indiana GOP Rep. Susan Brooks is planning to withdraw from her House reelection race and seek her party's gubernatorial nomination if Gov. Mike Pence leaves his race to serve as Donald Trump's ticket-mate.

"If the governor withdraws, then yes, she'd be committed to withdrawing her name from the ballot and seeking the gubernatorial nomination from the state committee," said Murray Clark, a former state GOP chair who is supporting Brooks and has been in touch with her.

Rep. Todd Rokita and state House Speaker Brain Bosma have publicly stated their interest in taking Pence's spot, too, should Trump tap him for vice president. (Indiana law prevents Pence from being on the ballot twice this fall.) Sources have also said Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb is interested as well. Former Gov. Mitch Daniels ruled out making a bid this morning.

The four remaining candidates will have until Friday at noon to put their names into the governor's race. The 22-member state Republican central committee would meet behind closed doors to pick a nominee at least 10 days after a Pence withdrawal.

Clark said Brooks had begun making calls to committee members - there are two from each of the state's nine congressional districts, plus four statewide officials - but said the ultimate outcome was still up in the air.

"That's the $64,000 question," Clark said, noting he would support any of the other candidates if they secured the nomination. "We've developed a pretty deep bench here."
