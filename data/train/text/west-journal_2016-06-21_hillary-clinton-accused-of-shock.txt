Hillary Clinton Accused Of Shocking Act With Bible In Fit Of Rage.

Gary Byrne, a former Secret Service agent for President Bill Clinton has written a book in which he exposes the rage and “eruptive” behavior of Hillary Clinton during her time as first lady.

Breitbart News has released an excerpt of the book. In the excerpt, the author wrote, “The First Lady had a different sort of liveliness.”

He went on to say, “She once threw a Bible at an agent on her detail, hitting him in the back of the head. He bluntly let her know it wasn’t acceptable. He told me that story himself.”

In the book, Byrne — who was posted at the door to the Oval Office for three years — states that an assignment to the former first lady’s detail was considered a punishment.

Byrne also wrote the agents knew to brace for the eruptions, saying, “They didn’t happen every day, but behind closed doors we learned about them fast. In public, she was everyone’s best friend. Privately, she was her normal self.”

At one point in the book, Byrne gives an account of Clinton telling one agent to “Go to hell!,” while telling another to, “Go f*** yourself!”

In an earlier article from Western Journalism, Byrne expressed concern that Clinton may become the next president.

He wrote, “Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.”

Bryne went on to say, “From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true. And with Hillary’s latest rise, I realize that her own leadership style — volcanic, impulsive, enabled by sycophants, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else — hasn’t changed a bit.”
