His mid-morning tweet followed another that attacked Clinton.

Trump’s campaign said the speech at the Trump SoHo New York Hotel would be “regarding the election.”

A Trump campaign source told NBC that this week’s address will lay out his case against Clinton, possibly highlighting the issues he’ll cover in the coming months.

Meanwhile, NBC’s Ali Vitali said the subject of the speech will be Clinton herself.

Earlier this month, Trump indicated that a major speech was forthcoming that would highlight the shortcomings of Clinton’s past.

Trump’s major anti-Clinton speech, which was never given due to the Orlando massacre on June 12, is expected to focus on three main areas of attack — the speaking fees Clinton has received from Wall Street companies, her role in the deaths of four Americans at Benghazi in 2012 and the subsequent investigation into her use of a private email server and Clinton’s past attacks on women with whom her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has been involved.

Trump has already foreshadowed the kind of rhetoric likely to come in an anti-Clinton speech.

“The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves,” Trump said. “They’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars. Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund.”
