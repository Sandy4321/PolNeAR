BOOM: Trump Just Fired A 5-Word Missile Directly At Hillary She WON’T Want Anyone To See.

In a slam-bang takedown summation of the Democratic presidential front-runner, Republican president candidate Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton lacks “the strength or the stamina” needed to run the country.

Trump further summed up Clinton as “terrible,” denounced her record as secretary of state and said she should not even be allowed to run for office due to the email scandal engulfing her. Clinton “caused tremendous havoc and tremendous death,” he said.

Trump’s comments came during a Fox & Friends interview Saturday hen he was asked about the former first lady as well as his Republican rivals. The Hillary Clinton segment of Trump’s talk starts about the 7 minute mark.

“She’s caused so many deaths,” Trump said. “You look at so many decisions that she made that were so bad, so horrible and honestly caused tremendous havoc and tremendous death.”

Trump said Clinton’s disastrous actions in Libya are not confined to the Benghazi scandal, in which four Americans were killed. Investigations have revealed that before the attacks, requests were made to Clinton for added security, but no action was ever taken.

Trump said he holds Clinton, during her tenure as America’s top diplomat, as being responsible for the Syrian and Iraqi refugee crisis that led to “hundreds of thousands or maybe millions” of refugees fleeing the two nations.

Trump’s comments about Clinton’s energy and stamina mirror those Trump made at a Dec. 4 rally in Raleigh, N.C.

“Do you ever notice she does an event, she wakes up? She does an event. Puts on her pantsuit. She walks in. … No it’s true. She walks in, does event and you don’t see her for four days, five days. You know why? She goes back home and she goes to sleep,” he said then.

“This is not what we need as a president. We need tremendous energy. We need tremendous smarts. We need somebody that is going to get the job done. We have to get the job done,” Trump said.
