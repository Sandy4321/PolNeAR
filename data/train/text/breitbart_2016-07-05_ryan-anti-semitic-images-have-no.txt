Ryan: ‘Anti-Semitic Images’ Have ‘No Place In A Presidential Campaign.’

Tuesday on WTMJ’s “Midday with Charlie Sykes,” while discussing a controversial tweet from presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump featuring an image of Hillary Clinton, money and a six-pointed star likened to the Star of David, Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said “anti-Semitic images, they’ve got no place in a presidential campaign.”

Ryan said,“Look, anti-Semitic images, they’ve got no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that. The tweet’s been deleted. I don’t know what flunky put this up there. They obviously have to fix that. We’ve got to get back to the issues that matter to the public.”

He added, “Look I’ve made this really really clear, the point is, I think he has got to clean this up. My understand is this was done by staff and not by he himself. But more importantly they’ve got to clean this thing up.”
