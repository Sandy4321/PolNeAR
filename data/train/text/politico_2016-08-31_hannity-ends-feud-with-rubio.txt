Hannity ends feud with Rubio.

Nearly six months after erupting on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for going after his attacks on Donald Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity indicated Tuesday night that any bad blood from the bruising Republican primary has largely abated.

"Marco Rubio won tonight and I was very glad to see that. I think we need him back in the Senate," Hannity said during a panel on his show after the first-term senator easily won his Senate primary, remarking that while there are "still some conservatives angry over comprehensive immigration reform," Rubio already "paid a very heavy political price in this 2016 [presidential] primary on that issue and he said he made a mistake."

Rubio "apologized numerous times on this show," Hannity said. "I think itâ€™s time for people to move on, we need him in the Senate."

Weighing in on the discussion, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee agreed, praising his former presidential primary opponent as "one of the most gifted, up-and-coming Republican stars that we've got."

"He's sharp. He's articulate. The fact that he, in his first term in the Senate, really tried to do something," Huckabee said. "You may not agree with what he did, but he went there because he was used to governing and seeing things done. And we absolutely ought to respect the fact that he apologized. He said, look, it wasn't the best thing to do. Let's not waste an extraordinary talent like Marco Rubio."

Hannity added, "I think Marco is still a rising star. I did think he made a mistake because he even said it wasn't the bill he wanted."
