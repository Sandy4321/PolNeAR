Trump, Cruz break away from the pack; 
Also of interest: Who will come out in second or third.

The Republican presidential nomination increasingly looks like a two-person race between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

The two are neck and neck in our Power Rankings this week; Trump was on top by a razor-thin margin. Everyone else lags far behind. Each week since early September we have asked a group of 30 political experts to rank who is the strongest candidate in the field. In recent weeks, it has been Trump and Cruz, and only the margins separating them from the pack has changed.

"It's become a two-person race in Iowa, because Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Chris Christie and Jeb Bush have failed to do what's necessary to compete there with Trump, Cruz and the rest of the field," said Craig Robinson, editor of TheIowaRepublican.com.

Iowa State University's Dianne Bystrom agreed. "Mainstream Republicans are running out of time to find an alternative to Trump or Cruz. At this point, that alternative may be Marco Rubio."

Or maybe Jeb Bush, digital consultant Phil Musser says. "Several surveys and direct feedback suggest a second look is occurring for Jeb in New Hampshire. ... But the core problem remains: a crowded lane to compete in."

This is the first time our rankings have been identical two weeks in a row.

Other spots matter as well. "The big battle is not just for first place in Iowa and New Hampshire, but who is the 'surprise' to come out in second, a close third or seriously exceeding expectations," Democratic pollster Peter Fenn said. "The next three weeks will see a rapid increase in the jockeying for position."
