Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it isn't in LIN's best interest.  Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years.  If LIN is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years, McCaw won't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it, and the independent directors will run the bidding. The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional Bell operating companies to purchase the company's interests
